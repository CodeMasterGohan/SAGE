In 2007, Thomas H. Davenport and Jeanne G. Harris wrote a groundbreaking book,

*Com-*

*peting on Analytics: The New Science of Winning*

(Boston: Harvard Business School

Press). They described how many organizations are using analytics strategically to make   
better decisions and improve customer and shareholder value. Over the past several years,   
we have seen remarkable growth in analytics among all types of organizations. The Insti-  
tute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) noted that ana-  
lytics software as a service is predicted to grow at three times the rate of other business   
segments in upcoming years.

1

In addition, the

*MIT Sloan Management Review*

in col-

laboration with the IBM Institute for Business Value surveyed a global sample of nearly   
3,000 executives, managers, and analysts.

2

This study concluded that top-performing

organizations use analytics five times more than lower performers, that improvement of   
information and analytics was a top priority in these organizations, and that many orga-  
nizations felt they were under significant pressure to adopt advanced information and   
analytics approaches. Since these reports were published, the interest in and the use of   
analytics has grown dramatically.

In reality, business analytics has been around for more than a half-century. Business

schools have long taught many of the core topics in business analytics---statistics, data   
analysis, information and decision support systems, and management science. However,   
these topics have traditionally been presented in separate and independent courses and   
supported by textbooks with little topical integration. This book is uniquely designed to   
present the emerging discipline of business analytics in a unified fashion consistent with   
the contemporary definition of the field.

About the Book

This book provides undergraduate business students and introductory graduate students   
with the fundamental concepts and tools needed to understand the role of modern business   
analytics in organizations, to apply basic business analytics tools in a spreadsheet environ-  
ment, and to communicate with analytics professionals to effectively use and interpret   
analytic models and results for making better business decisions. We take a balanced,   
holistic approach in viewing business analytics from descriptive, predictive, and prescrip-  
tive perspectives that define the discipline.

"Analytics: The New Path to Value,"

*MIT Sloan Management Review*

Research Report, Fall 2010.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive019.png)

Preface

This book is organized in five parts.

1.

Foundations of Business Analytics

The first two chapters provide the basic foundations needed to understand business   
analytics and to manipulate data using Microsoft Excel. [Chapter 1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30)provides an intro-  
duction to business analytics and its key concepts and terminology, and includes an   
appendix that reviews basic Excel skills.[Chapter 2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#76), Database Analytics, is a unique   
chapter that covers intermediate Excel skills, Excel template design, and PivotTables.

2.

Descriptive Analytics

[Chapters 3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#114)through [7](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#276) cover fundamental tools and methods of data analysis and   
statistics. These chapters focus on data visualization, descriptive statistical mea-  
sures, probability distributions and data modeling, sampling and estimation, and   
statistical inference. We subscribe to the American Statistical Association's rec-  
ommendations for teaching introductory statistics, which include emphasizing   
statistical literacy and developing statistical thinking, stressing conceptual under-  
standing rather than mere knowledge of procedures, and using technology for   
developing conceptual understanding and analyzing data. We believe these goals   
can be accomplished without introducing every conceivable technique into an   
800--1,000 page book as many mainstream books currently do. In fact, we cover   
all essential content that the state of Ohio has mandated for undergraduate busi-  
ness statistics across all public colleges and universities.

3.

Predictive Analytics

In this section, [Chapters 8](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#312) through [12](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#452)develop approaches for applying trendlines   
and regression analysis, forecasting, introductory data mining techniques, build-  
ing and analyzing models on spreadsheets, and simulation and risk analysis.

4.

Prescriptive Analytics

[Chapters 13](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494)and [14](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#552)explore linear, integer, and nonlinear optimization models   
[and applications. Chapter 15, Optimization Analytics, focuses on what-if and sen](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#594)-  
sitivity analysis in optimization, and visualization of Solver reports.

5.

Making Decisions

[Chapter 16 focuses on philosophies, tools, and techniques of decision analysis.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#632)

Changes to the Third Edition

The third edition represents a comprehensive revision that includes many significant   
changes. The book now relies only on native Excel, and is independent of platforms,   
allowing it to be used easily by students with either PC or Mac computers. These changes   
provide students with enhanced Excel skills and basic understanding of fundamental con-  
cepts.

*Analytic Solver*

is no longer integrated directly in the book, but is illustrated in

online supplements to facilitate revision as new software updates may occur. These sup-  
plements plus information regarding how to access

*Analytic Solver*

may be accessed at

problems for additional clarity. We use major section headings in each chapter   
and tie these clearly to the problems and exercises, which have been revised   
and updated throughout the book. At the end of each section we added several   
"Check Your Understanding" questions that provide a basic review of fundamental   
concepts to improve student learning. Finally, new Analytics in Practice features   
have been incorporated into several chapters.

Chapter 1

Introduction to Business Analytics

The purpose of this book is to provide you with a basic introduction to the

concepts, methods, and models used in business analytics so that you will

develop an appreciation not only for its capabilities to support and enhance busi-

ness decisions, but also for the ability to use business analytics at an elementary

level in your work. In this chapter, we introduce you to the field of business analyt-

ics and set the foundation for many of the concepts and techniques that you will

learn. Let's start with a rather innovative example.

Most of you have likely been to a zoo, seen the animals, had something to eat,

and bought some souvenirs. You probably wouldn't think that managing a zoo is

very difficult; after all, it's just feeding and taking care of the animals, right? A zoo

might be the last place that you would expect to find business analytics being used,

but not anymore. The Cincinnati Zoo \& Botanical Garden has been an "early

adopter" and one of the first organizations of its kind to exploit business analytics.

1

Despite generating more than two-thirds of its budget through its own fund-

raising efforts, the zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on local tax subsidies even

further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources

such as membership, food, and retail outlets. The zoo's senior management sur-

mised that the best way to realize more value from each visit was to offer visi-

tors a truly transformed customer experience. By using business analytics to gain

greater insight into visitors' behavior and tailoring operations to their preferences,

the zoo expected to increase attendance, boost membership, and maximize sales.

The project team---which consisted of consultants from IBM and Brightstar

Partners, as well as senior executives from the zoo---began translating the organi-

zation's goals into technical solutions. The zoo worked to create a business ana-

lytics platform that was capable of delivering the desired goals by combining data

from ticketing and point-of-sale systems throughout the zoo with membership

information and geographical data gathered from the ZIP codes of all visitors.

This enabled the creation of reports and dashboards that gave everyone from

senior managers to zoo staff access to real-time information that helped them

optimize operational management and transform the customer experience.

By integrating weather forecast data, the zoo is now able to compare current

forecasts with historic attendance and sales data, supporting better decision mak-

ing for labor scheduling and inventory planning. Another area where the solution

delivers new insight is food service. By opening food outlets at specific times of

day when demand is highest (for example, keeping ice cream kiosks open in the

final hour before the zoo closes), the zoo has been able to increase sales signifi-

cantly. In addition, attendance and revenues have dramatically increased, resulting

in annual return on investment of 411%. The business analytics initiative paid for

itself within three months and delivers, on average, benefits of $738,212 per year.

Specifically,

■

The zoo has seen a 4.2% rise in ticket sales by targeting potential visitors who

live in specific ZIP codes.

■

■

Food revenues increased 25% by optimizing the mix of products on sale and

adapting selling practices to match peak purchase times.

■

■

Eliminating slow-selling products and targeting visitors with specific promo-

tions enabled an 18% increase in merchandise sales.

The zoo was able to cut its marketing expenditure, saving $40,000 in the first

year, and reduce advertising expenditure by 43% by eliminating ineffective

campaigns and segmenting customers for more targeted marketing.

Because of the zoo's success, other organizations such as Point Defiance Zoo

\& Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington, and History Colorado Center, a museum in

Denver, have embarked on similar initiatives.

What Is Business Analytics?

Everyone makes decisions. Individuals face personal decisions such as choosing a college or   
graduate program, making product purchases, selecting a mortgage instrument, and invest-  
ing for retirement. Managers in business organizations make numerous decisions every day.   
Some of these decisions include what products to make and how to price them, where to   
locate facilities, how many people to hire, where to allocate advertising budgets, whether or   
not to outsource a business function or make a capital investment, and how to schedule pro-  
duction. Many of these decisions have significant economic consequences; moreover, they   
are difficult to make because of uncertain data and imperfect information about the future.

Managers today no longer make decisions based on pure judgment and experience;

they rely on factual data and the ability to manipulate and analyze data to supplement their   
intuition and experience, and to justify their decisions. What makes business decisions com-  
plicated today is the overwhelming amount of available data and information. Data to sup-  
port business decisions---including those specifically collected by firms as well as through   
the Internet and social media such as Facebook---are growing exponentially and becoming   
increasingly difficult to understand and use. As a result, many companies have recently   
established analytics departments; for instance, IBM reorganized its consulting business   
and established a new 4,000-person organization focusing on analytics. Companies are   
increasingly seeking business graduates with the ability to understand and use analytics.   
The demand for professionals with analytics expertise has skyrocketed, and many universi-  
ties now have programs in analytics.

Chapter 1

Introduction to Business Analytics

**Business analytics**

, or simply

**analytics**

, is the use of data, information technology,

statistical analysis, quantitative methods, and mathematical or computer-based models to   
help managers gain improved insight about their business operations and make better,   
fact-based decisions. Business analytics is "a process of transforming data into actions   
through analysis and insights in the context of organizational decision making and prob-  
lem solving."

3

Business analytics is supported by various tools such as Microsoft Excel

and various Excel add-ins, commercial statistical software packages such as SAS or   
Minitab, and more complex business intelligence suites that integrate data with analytical   
software.

[Using Business Analytics](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Tools and techniques of business analytics are used across many areas in a wide variety of   
organizations to improve the management of customer relationships, financial and market-  
ing activities, human capital, supply chains, and many other areas. Leading banks use ana-  
lytics to predict and prevent credit fraud. Investment firms use analytics to select the best   
client portfolios to manage risk and optimize return. Manufacturers use analytics for pro-  
duction planning, purchasing, and inventory management. Retailers use analytics to rec-  
ommend products to customers and optimize marketing promotions. Pharmaceutical firms   
use analytics to get life-saving drugs to market more quickly. The leisure and vacation   
industries use analytics to analyze historical sales data, understand customer behavior,   
improve Web site design, and optimize schedules and bookings. Airlines and hotels use   
analytics to dynamically set prices over time to maximize revenue. Even sports teams are   
using business analytics to determine both game strategy and optimal ticket prices.

4

For

example, teams use analytics to decide on ticket pricing, who to recruit and trade, what   
combinations of players work best, and what plays to run under different situations.

Among the many organizations that use analytics to make strategic decisions and

manage day-to-day operations are Caesars Entertainment, the Cleveland Indians base-  
ball, Phoenix Suns basketball, and New England Patriots football teams,[Amazon.com,](http://amazon.com/)Procter \& Gamble, United Parcel Service (UPS), and Capital One bank. It was reported   
that nearly all firms with revenues of more than $100 million are using some form of busi-  
ness analytics.

Some common types of business decisions that can be enhanced by using analytics

include

■

■

pricing (for example, setting prices for consumer and industrial goods, govern-  
ment contracts, and maintenance contracts),

■

■

customer segmentation (for example, identifying and targeting key customer   
groups in retail, insurance, and credit card industries),

■

■

merchandising (for example, determining brands to buy, quantities, and   
allocations),

■

■

location (for example, finding the best location for bank branches and ATMs, or   
where to service industrial equipment),

■

■

supply chain design (for example, determining the best sourcing and transporta-  
tion options and finding the best delivery routes),

health care (for example, scheduling operating rooms to improve utilization,   
improving patient flow and waiting times, purchasing supplies, predicting health   
risk factors),

and many others in operations management, finance, marketing, and human resources---in   
fact, in every discipline of business.

5

Various research studies have discovered strong relationships between a company's per-

formance in terms of profitability, revenue, and shareholder return and its use of analytics.   
Top-performing organizations (those that outperform their competitors) are three times more   
likely to be sophisticated in their use of analytics than lower performers and are more likely   
to state that their use of analytics differentiates them from competitors.

6

However, research

has also suggested that organizations are overwhelmed by data and struggle to understand   
how to use data to achieve business results and that most organizations simply don't under-  
stand how to use analytics to improve their businesses. Thus, understanding the capabilities   
and techniques of analytics is vital to managing in today's business environment.

So, no matter what your job position in an organization is or will be, the study of

analytics will be quite important to your future success. You may find many uses in your   
everyday work for the Excel-based tools that we will study. You may not be skilled in all   
the technical nuances of analytics and supporting software, but you will, at the very least,   
be a consumer of analytics and work with analytics professionals to support your analy-  
ses and decisions. For example, you might find yourself on project teams with managers   
who know very little about analytics and analytics experts such as statisticians, program-  
mers, and economists. Your role might be to ensure that analytics is used properly to solve   
important business problems.

[Impacts and Challenges](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

The benefits of applying business analytics can be significant. Companies report reduced   
costs, better risk management, faster decisions, better productivity, and enhanced   
bottom-line performance such as profitability and customer satisfaction. For example,   
[1-800- Flowers.com](http://1800flowers.com/) used analytic software to target print and online promotions with   
greater accuracy; change prices and offerings on its Web site (sometimes hourly); and opti-  
mize its marketing, shipping, distribution, and manufacturing operations, resulting in a   
$50 million cost savings in one year.

7

Business analytics is changing how managers make decisions.

8

To thrive in today's busi-

ness world, organizations must continually innovate to differentiate themselves from competi-  
tors, seek ways to grow revenue and market share, reduce costs, retain existing customers and   
acquire new ones, and become faster and leaner. IBM suggests that traditional management

Introduction to Business Analytics

approaches are evolving in today's analytics-driven environment to include more fact-based   
decisions as opposed to judgment and intuition, more prediction rather than reactive decisions,   
and the use of analytics by everyone at the point where decisions are made rather than relying   
on skilled experts in a consulting group.

9

Nevertheless, organizations face many challenges in

developing analytics capabilities, including lack of understanding of how to use analytics,   
competing business priorities, insufficient analytical skills, difficulty in getting good data and   
sharing information, and not understanding the benefits versus perceived costs of analytics   
studies. Successful application of analytics requires more than just knowing the tools; it   
requires a high-level understanding of how analytics supports an organization's competitive   
strategy and effective execution that crosses multiple disciplines and managerial levels.

In 2011, a survey by Bloomberg Businessweek Research Services and SAS concluded

that business analytics was still in the "emerging stage" and was used only narrowly within   
business units, not across entire organizations. The study also noted that many organiza-  
tions lacked analytical talent, and those that did have analytical talent often didn't know   
how to apply the results properly. While analytics was used as part of the decision-making   
process in many organizations, most business decisions are still based on intuition.

10

Today, business analytics has matured in many organizations, but many more opportunities   
still exist. These opportunities are reflected in the job market for analytics professionals, or   
"data scientists," as some call them. McKinsey \& Company suggested that there is a short-  
age of qualified data scientists.

Analytical methods, in one form or another, have been used in business for more than a   
century. The core of business analytics consists of three disciplines: business intelligence   
and information systems, statistics, and modeling and optimization.

[Analytic Foundations](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

The modern evolution of analytics began with the introduction of computers in the late   
1940s and their development through the 1960s and beyond. Early computers provided the   
ability to store and analyze data in ways that were either very difficult or impossible to do   
manually. This facilitated the collection, management, analysis, and reporting of data, which

is often called

**business intelligence (BI)**

, a term that was coined in 1958 by an IBM

researcher, Hans Peter Luhn.

12

Business intelligence software can answer basic questions

such as "How many units did we sell last month?" "What products did customers buy and   
how much did they spend?" "How many credit card transactions were completed yester-  
day?" Using BI, we can create simple rules to flag exceptions automatically; for example, a   
bank can easily identify transactions greater than $10,000 to report to the Internal Revenue   
Service.

13

BI has evolved into the modern discipline we now call

**information systems (IS)**

.

**Statistics**

has a long and rich history, yet only rather recently has it been recognized as

an important element of business, driven to a large extent by the massive growth of data in   
today's world. Google's chief economist noted that statisticians surely have one of the best   
jobs.

14

Statistical methods allow us to gain a richer understanding of data that goes beyond

business intelligence reporting by not only summarizing data succinctly but also finding   
unknown and interesting relationships among the data. Statistical methods include the   
basic tools of description, exploration, estimation, and inference, as well as more advanced   
techniques like regression, forecasting, and data mining.

Much of modern business analytics stems from the analysis and solution of complex

decision problems using mathematical or computer-based models---a discipline known as   
operations research, or management science.

*Operations research (OR)*

was born from

efforts to improve military operations prior to and during World War II. After the war,   
scientists recognized that the mathematical tools and techniques developed for military   
applications could be applied successfully to problems in business and industry. A sig-  
nificant amount of research was carried on in public and private think tanks during the   
late 1940s and through the 1950s. As the focus on business applications expanded, the   
term

*management science (MS)*

became more prevalent. Many people use the terms

*opera-*

*tions research*

and

*management science*

interchangeably, so the field became known as

**Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS)**

. Many OR/MS applications use

**modeling and optimization**

---techniques for translating real problems into mathematics,

spreadsheets, or various computer languages, and using them to find the best ("optimal")   
solutions and decisions. INFORMS, the Institute for Operations Research and the Manage-  
ment Sciences, is the leading professional society devoted to OR/MS and analytics and   
publishes a bimonthly magazine called

Modern business analytics can be viewed as an integration of BI/IS, statistics, and model-  
ing and optimization, as illustrated in[Figure 1.1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#37). While these core topics are traditional   
and have been used for decades, the uniqueness lies in their intersections. For example,

**data mining**

is focused on better understanding characteristics and patterns among vari-

ables in large databases using a variety of statistical and analytical tools. Many standard   
statistical tools as well as more advanced ones are used extensively in data mining.

**Simu-**

**lation and risk analysis**

relies on spreadsheet models and statistical analysis to examine

the impacts of uncertainty in estimates and their potential interaction with one another on   
the output variable of interest.

Introduction to Business Analytics

**Decision support systems (DSSs)**

began to evolve in the 1960s by combining busi-

ness intelligence concepts with OR/MS models to create analytical-based computer sys-  
tems to support decision making. DSSs include three components:

**1.**

*Data management*

. The data management component includes databases for

storing data and allows the user to input, retrieve, update, and manipulate data.

**2.**

*Model management*

. The model management component consists of various

statistical tools and management science models and allows the user to easily   
build, manipulate, analyze, and solve models.

**3.**

*Communication system*

. The communication system component provides the

interface necessary for the user to interact with the data and model management   
components.

15

DSSs have been used for many applications, including pension fund management, portfolio   
management, work-shift scheduling, global manufacturing and facility location, advertising-  
budget allocation, media planning, distribution planning, airline operations planning, inven-  
tory control, library management, classroom assignment, nurse scheduling, blood distribution,   
water pollution control, ski-area design, police-beat design, and energy planning.

16

A key feature of a DSS is the ability to perform

**what-if analysis**

---how specific com-

binations of inputs that reflect key assumptions will affect model outputs. What-if analysis   
is also used to assess the sensitivity of optimization models to changes in data inputs and   
provide better insight for making good decisions.

Perhaps the most useful component of business analytics, which makes it truly unique,

is the center of [Figure 1.1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#37)---

**visualization**

. Visualizing data and results of analyses provides

a way of easily communicating data at all levels of a business and can reveal surprising pat-  
terns and relationships. Software such as IBM's Cognos system exploits data visualization

and other metrics for prediction and marketing strategies. UPS uses telematics to capture

Many companies, such as IBM, SAS, and Tableau Software, have developed a variety of   
software and hardware solutions to support business analytics. For example, IBM's Cognos   
Express, an integrated business intelligence and planning solution designed to meet the needs   
of midsize companies, provides reporting, analysis, dashboard, scorecard, planning, budget-  
ing, and forecasting capabilities. It is made up of several modules, including Cognos Express   
Reporter, for self-service reporting and ad hoc query; Cognos Express Advisor, for analysis and   
visualization; and Cognos Express Xcelerator, for Excel-based planning and business analysis.   
Information is presented to users in a context that makes it easy to understand; with an easy-  
to-use interface, users can quickly gain the insight they need from their data to make the right   
decisions and then take action for effective and efficient business optimization and outcome.   
SAS provides a variety of software that integrate data management, business intelligence, and   
analytics tools. SAS Analytics covers a wide range of capabilities, including predictive model-  
ing and data mining, visualization, forecasting, optimization and model management, statisti-  
cal analysis, text analytics, and more. Tableau Software provides simple drag and drop tools   
for visualizing data from spreadsheets and other databases. We encourage you to explore many   
of these products as you learn the basic principles of business analytics in this book.

Although commercial software often have powerful features and capabilities, they can

be expensive, generally require advanced training to understand and apply, and may work   
only on specific computer platforms. Spreadsheet software, on the other hand, is widely   
used across all areas of business and used by nearly everyone. Spreadsheets are an effec-  
tive platform for manipulating data and developing and solving models; they support pow-  
erful commercial add-ins and facilitate communication of results. Spreadsheets provide a   
flexible modeling environment and are particularly useful when the end user is not the   
designer of the model. Teams can easily use spreadsheets and understand the logic upon   
which they are built. Information in spreadsheets can easily be copied from spreadsheets   
into other documents and presentations. A recent survey identified more than 180 commer-  
cial spreadsheet products that support analytics efforts, including data management and   
reporting, data- and model-driven analytical techniques, and implementation.

17

Many

organizations have used spreadsheets extremely effectively to support decision making in   
marketing, finance, and operations. Some illustrative applications include the following:

Spreadsheet technology has been influential in promoting the use and acceptance of

business analytics. Spreadsheets provide a convenient way to manage data, calculations,   
and visual graphics simultaneously, using intuitive representations instead of abstract   
mathematical notation. Although the early applications of spreadsheets were primarily in   
accounting and finance, spreadsheets have developed into powerful general-purpose mana-  
gerial tools for applying techniques of business analytics. The power of analytics in a per-  
sonal computing environment was noted decades ago by business consultants Michael   
Hammer and James Champy, who said, "When accessible data is combined with easy-to-  
use analysis and modeling tools, frontline workers---when properly trained--- suddenly   
have sophisticated decision-making capabilities."

One of the emerging applications of analytics is helping   
businesses learn from social media and exploit social   
media data for strategic advantage.

20

Using analytics,

firms can integrate social media data with traditional data   
sources such as customer surveys, focus groups, and   
sales data; understand trends and customer perceptions   
of their products; and create informative reports to assist   
marketing managers and product designers.

Social media analytics is useful in decision making in

many business domains to understand how user- generated   
content spreads and influences user interactions, how   
information is transmitted, and how it influences decisions.   
A review of research published in social media analytics   
provides numerous examples:

Social media platforms enable citizens' engagement with   
politicians, governments, and other citizens. Studies   
have examined how voters discuss the candidates dur-  
ing an election, how candidates are adopting Twitter for   
campaigning and influencing conversations in the pub-  
lic space, and how presidential candidates in the United   
States used Twitter to engage people and identify the   
topics mentioned by candidates during their campaigns.   
Others have used analytics to track political preference by   
monitoring online popularity.

In this book, we use Microsoft Excel as the primary platform for implementing ana-

lytics. [In the Chapter 1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30)Appendix, we review some key Excel skills that you should have   
before moving forward in this book.

*The main chapters in this book are designed using Excel 2016 for Windows or Excel*

*2016 for Mac.*

Earlier versions of Excel do not have all the capabilities that we use in this

book. In addition, some key differences exist between Windows and Mac versions that   
we will occasionally point out. Thus, some Excel tools that we will describe in chapter   
appendixes require you to use Excel for Windows, Office 365, or Google Sheets, and will   
not run on Excel for Mac; these are optional to learn, and are not required for any examples   
or problems. Your instructor may use optional software, such as XLSTAT and StatCrunch,   
which are provided by the publisher (Pearson), or Analytic Solver, which is described in   
online supplements to this book.

Retail organizations monitor and analyze social media   
data about their own products and services and also   
about their competitors' products and services to stay   
competitive. For instance, one study analyzed different

Business analytics begins with the collection, organization, and manipulation of data and   
is supported by three major components:

*Descriptive analytics*

. Most businesses start with

**descriptive analytics**

---the

use of data to understand past and current business performance and make   
informed decisions. Descriptive analytics is the most commonly used and most   
well-understood type of analytics. These techniques categorize, characterize,   
consolidate, and classify data to convert them into useful information for the   
purposes of understanding and analyzing business performance. Descriptive

Chapter 1

Introduction to Business Analytics

analytics summarizes data into meaningful charts and reports, for example,   
about budgets, sales, revenues, or cost. This process allows managers to obtain   
standard and customized reports and then drill down into the data and make   
queries to understand the impact of an advertising campaign, such as reviewing   
business performance to find problems or areas of opportunity, and identifying   
patterns and trends in data. Typical questions that descriptive analytics helps   
answer are "How much did we sell in each region?" "What was our revenue and   
profit last quarter?" "How many and what types of complaints did we resolve?"   
"Which factory has the lowest productivity?" Descriptive analytics also helps   
companies to classify customers into different segments, which enables them to   
develop specific marketing campaigns and advertising strategies.

**2.**

*Predictive analytics*

.

**Predictive analytics**

seeks to predict the future by exam-

ining historical data, detecting patterns or relationships in these data, and then   
extrapolating these relationships forward in time. For example, a marketer   
might wish to predict the response of different customer segments to an adver-  
tising campaign, a commodities trader might wish to predict short-term move-  
ments in commodities prices, or a skiwear manufacturer might want to predict   
next season's demand for skiwear of a specific color and size. Predictive analyt-  
ics can predict risk and find relationships in data not readily apparent with tradi-  
tional analyses. Using advanced techniques, predictive analytics can help detect   
hidden patterns in large quantities of data, and segment and group data into   
coherent sets to predict behavior and detect trends. For instance, a bank man-  
ager might want to identify the most profitable customers, predict the chances   
that a loan applicant will default, or alert a credit card customer to a potential   
fraudulent charge. Predictive analytics helps to answer questions such as "What   
will happen if demand falls by 10% or if supplier prices go up 5%?" "What do   
we expect to pay for fuel over the next several months?" "What is the risk of   
losing money in a new business venture?"

**3.**

*Prescriptive analytics*

. Many problems, such as aircraft or employee scheduling

and supply chain design, simply involve too many choices or alternatives for   
a human decision maker to effectively consider.

**Prescriptive analytics**

uses

optimization to identify the best alternatives to minimize or maximize some   
objective. Prescriptive analytics is used in many areas of business, including   
operations, marketing, and finance. For example, we may determine the best   
pricing and advertising strategy to maximize revenue, the optimal amount of   
cash to store in ATMs, or the best mix of investments in a retirement portfolio   
to manage risk. Prescriptive analytics addresses questions such as "How much   
should we produce to maximize profit?" "What is the best way of shipping   
goods from our factories to minimize costs?" "Should we change our plans   
if a natural disaster closes a supplier's factory, and if so, by how much?" The   
mathematical and statistical techniques of predictive analytics can also be com-  
bined with prescriptive analytics to make decisions that take into account the   
uncertainty in the data.

A wide variety of tools are used to support business analytics. These include

■

■

Database queries and analysis

■

"Dashboards" to report key performance measures

Sometime during their lives, most Americans will receive   
a mortgage loan for a house or condominium. The pro-  
cess starts with an application. The application contains   
all pertinent information about the borrower that the lender   
will need. The bank or mortgage company then initiates   
a process that leads to a loan decision. It is here that   
key information about the borrower is provided by third-  
party providers. This information includes a credit report,   
verification of income, verification of assets, verification of   
employment, and an appraisal of the property. The result   
of the processing function is a complete loan file that   
contains all the information and documents needed to   
underwrite the loan, which is the next step in the process.   
Underwriting is where the loan application is evaluated for   
its risk. Underwriters evaluate whether the borrower can   
make payments on time, can afford to pay back the loan,   
and has sufficient collateral in the property to back up the   
loan. In the event the borrower defaults on their loan, the   
lender can sell the property to recover the amount of the   
loan. But if the amount of the loan is greater than the value   
of the property, then the lender cannot recoup their money.   
If the underwriting process indicates that the borrower is   
creditworthy and has the capacity to repay the loan and   
the value of the property in question is greater than the   
loan amount, then the loan is approved and will move to   
closing. Closing is the step where the borrower signs all   
the appropriate papers, agreeing to the terms of the loan.

In reality, lenders have a lot of other work to do. First,

they must perform a quality control review on a sample   
of the loan files that involves a manual examination of all   
the documents and information gathered. This process   
is designed to identify any mistakes that may have been   
made or information that is missing from the loan file.   
Because lenders do not have unlimited money to lend to   
borrowers, they frequently sell the loan to a third party so   
that they have fresh capital to lend to others. This occurs   
in what is called the secondary market. Freddie Mac and   
Fannie Mae are the two largest purchasers of mortgages   
in the secondary market. The final step in the process   
is servicing. Servicing includes all the activities associ-  
ated with providing the customer service on the loan, like   
processing payments, managing property taxes held in   
escrow, and answering questions about the loan.

In addition, the institution collects various operational

data on the process to track its performance and effi-  
ciency, including the number of applications, loan types and   
amounts, cycle times (time to close the loan), bottlenecks in   
the process, and so on. Many different types of analytics are   
used:  
Descriptive analytics---This focuses on historical reporting,   
addressing such questions as

■

■

How many loan applications were taken in each of the   
past 12 months?

■

■

What was the total cycle time from application to close?

■

■

What was the distribution of loan profitability by   
credit score and loan-to-value (LTV), which is the   
mortgage amount divided by the appraised value of   
the property?

Predictive analytics---Predictive modeling uses mathemati-  
cal, spreadsheet, and statistical models and addresses ques-  
tions such as

■

■

What impact on loan volume will a given marketing pro-  
gram have?

■

■

How many processors or underwriters are needed for a   
given loan volume?

■

■

Will a given process change reduce cycle time?

Prescriptive analytics---This involves the use of simulation or   
optimization to drive decisions. Typical questions include

■

■

What is the optimal staffing to achieve a given profitability   
constrained by a fixed cycle time?

■

■

What is the optimal product mix to maximize profit con-  
strained by fixed staffing?

The mortgage market has become much more dynamic

in recent years due to rising home values, falling interest   
rates, new loan products, and an increased desire by home   
owners to utilize the equity in their homes as a financial   
resource. This has increased the complexity and variability of   
the mortgage process and created an opportunity for lenders   
to proactively use the data that are available to them as a tool   
for managing their business. To ensure that the process is   
efficient, effective, and performed with quality, data and ana-  
lytics are used every day to track what is done, who is doing   
it, and how long it takes.

Operations Research in Business Analytics," INFORMS Conference on Business Analytics and Operations   
Research, April 10--12, 2011.

As you probably know from your shopping experiences,   
most department stores and fashion retailers clear their sea-  
sonal inventory by reducing prices. The key question they   
face is what prices should they set---and when should they   
set them---to meet inventory goals and maximize revenue?   
For example, suppose that a store has 100 bathing suits   
of a certain style that go on sale on April 1 and wants to   
sell all of them by the end of June. Over each week of the   
12-week selling season, they can make a decision to dis-  
count the price. They face two decisions: When to reduce   
the price, and by how much. This results in 24 decisions to

make. For a major national chain that may carry thousands   
of products, this can easily result in millions of decisions that   
store managers have to make. Descriptive analytics can be   
used to examine historical data for similar products, such as   
the number of units sold, price at each point of sale, starting   
and ending inventories, and special promotions, newspaper   
ads, direct marketing ads, and so on, to understand what the   
results of past decisions achieved. Predictive analytics can   
be used to predict sales based on pricing decisions. Finally,   
prescriptive analytics can be applied to find the best set of   
pricing decisions to maximize the total revenue.

Since the dawn of the electronic age and the Internet, both individuals and organizations have   
had access to an enormous wealth of data and information. Most data are collected through   
some type of measurement process, and consist of numbers (e.g., sales revenues) or tex-  
tual data (e.g., customer demographics such as gender). Other data might be extracted from   
social media, online reviews, and even audio and video files.

*Information*

comes from analyz-

ing data---that is, extracting meaning from data to support evaluation and decision making.

Data are used in virtually every major function in a business. Modern organizations---

which include not only for-profit businesses but also nonprofit organizations---need good   
data to support a variety of company purposes, such as planning, reviewing company per-  
formance, improving operations, and comparing company performance with competitors'

or best-practice benchmarks. Some examples of how data are used in business include the   
following:

■

■

Annual reports summarize data about companies' profitability and market   
share both in numerical form and in charts and graphs to communicate with   
shareholders.

■

■

Accountants conduct audits to determine whether figures reported on a firm's   
balance sheet fairly represent the actual data by examining samples (that is, sub-  
sets) of accounting data, such as accounts receivable.

■

■

Financial analysts collect and analyze a variety of data to understand the contri-  
bution that a business provides to its shareholders. These typically include profit-  
ability, revenue growth, return on investment, asset utilization, operating margins,   
earnings per share, economic value added (EVA), shareholder value, and other   
relevant measures.

■

■

Economists use data to help companies understand and predict population trends,   
interest rates, industry performance, consumer spending, and international trade.   
Such data are often obtained from external sources such as Standard \& Poor's   
Compustat data sets, industry trade associations, or government databases.

■

■

Marketing researchers collect and analyze extensive customer data. These data   
often consist of demographics, preferences and opinions, transaction and pay-  
ment history, shopping behavior, and much more. Such data may be collected   
by surveys, personal interviews, or focus groups, or from shopper loyalty   
cards.

■

■

Operations managers use data on production performance, manufacturing qual-  
ity, delivery times, order accuracy, supplier performance, productivity, costs, and   
environmental compliance to manage their operations.

■

■

Human resource managers measure employee satisfaction, training costs, turn-  
over, market innovation, training effectiveness, and skills development.

Data may be gathered from primary sources such as internal company records and business   
transactions, automated data-capturing equipment, and customer market surveys and from   
secondary sources such as government and commercial data sources, custom research pro-  
viders, and online research.

Perhaps the most important source of data today is data obtained from the Web. With

today's technology, marketers collect extensive information about Web behaviors, such as   
the number of page views, visitor's country, time of view, length of time, origin and desti-  
nation paths, products they searched for and viewed, products purchased, and what reviews   
they read. Using analytics, marketers can learn what content is being viewed most often,   
what ads were clicked on, who the most frequent visitors are, and what types of visitors   
browse but don't buy. Not only can marketers understand what customers have done, but   
they can better predict what they intend to do in the future. For example, if a bank knows   
that a customer has browsed for mortgage rates and homeowner's insurance, they can tar-  
get the customer with homeowner loans rather than credit cards or automobile loans. Tra-  
ditional Web data are now being enhanced with social media data from Facebook, cell   
phones, and even Internet-connected gaming devices.

As one example, a home furnishings retailer wanted to increase the rate of sales for

customers who browsed their Web site. They developed a large data set that covered more   
than 7,000 demographic, Web, catalog, and retail behavioral attributes for each customer.   
They used predictive analytics to determine how well a customer would respond to differ-  
ent e-mail marketing offers and customized promotions to individual customers. This not   
only helped them to determine where to most effectively spend marketing resources but

Today, nearly all data are captured digitally. As a result, data have been growing at an over-  
whelming rate, being measured by terabytes (10

12

bytes), petabytes (10

15

bytes), exabytes

(10

18

bytes), and even by higher-dimensional terms. Just think of the amount of data stored

on Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon servers, or the amount of data acquired daily from scan-  
ning items at a national grocery chain such as Kroger and its affiliates. Walmart, for instance,   
has over one million transactions each hour, yielding more than 2.5 petabytes of data. Ana-  
lytics professionals have coined the term

**big data**

to refer to massive amounts of business

data from a wide variety of sources, much of which is available in real time. IBM calls these   
characteristics

*volume*

,

*variety*

, and

*velocity*

. Most often, big data revolve around customer

behavior and customer experiences. Big data provide an opportunity for organizations to   
gain a competitive advantage---if the data can be understood and analyzed effectively to   
make better business decisions.

The volume of data continues to increase; what is considered "big" today will be

even bigger tomorrow. In one study of information technology (IT) professionals in 2010,   
nearly half of survey respondents ranked data growth among their top three challenges.   
Big data are captured using sensors (for example, supermarket scanners), click streams   
from the Web, customer transactions, e-mails, tweets and social media, and other ways.   
Big data sets are unstructured and messy, requiring sophisticated analytics to integrate   
and process the data and understand the information contained in them. Because much big   
data are being captured in real time, they must be incorporated into business decisions at   
a faster rate. Processes such as fraud detection must be analyzed quickly to have value. In   
addition to

*volume*

,

*variety*

, and

*velocity*

, IBM proposed a fourth dimension:

*veracity*

---the

level of reliability associated with data. Having high-quality data and understanding the   
uncertainty in data are essential for good decision making. Data veracity is an important   
role for statistical methods.

Big data can help organizations better understand and predict customer behavior and

improve customer service. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute noted that, "The   
effective use of big data has the potential to transform economies, delivering a new wave of   
productivity growth and consumer surplus. Using big data will become a key basis of com-  
petition for existing companies, and will create new competitors who are able to attract   
employees that have the critical skills for a big data world."

26

However, understanding big

data requires advanced analytics tools such as data mining and text analytics, and new   
technologies such as cloud computing, faster multi-core processors, large memory spaces,   
and solid-state drives.

and customers. But when the solution was represented on a geographic information system   
(GIS) mapping program, one of the customers was located in the Atlantic Ocean.

Thus, data used in business decisions need to be reliable and valid.

**Reliability**

means

that data are accurate and consistent.

**Validity**

means that data correctly measure what they

are supposed to measure. For example, a tire pressure gauge that consistently reads several   
pounds of pressure below the true value is not reliable, although it is valid because it does   
measure tire pressure. The number of calls to a customer service desk might be counted   
correctly each day (and thus is a reliable measure), but it is not valid if it is used to assess   
customer dissatisfaction, as many calls may be simple queries. Finally, a survey question   
that asks a customer to rate the quality of the food in a restaurant may be neither reliable   
(because different customers may have conflicting perceptions) nor valid (if the intent is to   
measure customer satisfaction, as satisfaction generally includes other elements of service   
besides food).

To make an informed decision, we must be able to specify the decision alternatives that   
represent the choices that can be made and criteria for evaluating the alternatives. Specify-  
ing decision alternatives might be very simple; for example, you might need to choose one   
of three corporate health plan options. Other situations can be more complex; for example,   
in locating a new distribution center, it might not be possible to list just a small number of   
alternatives. The set of potential locations might be anywhere in the United States or even   
across the globe. Decision criteria might be to maximize discounted net profits, customer   
satisfaction, or social benefits or to minimize costs, environmental impact, or some mea-  
sure of loss.

Many decision problems can be formalized using a model. A

**model**

is an abstraction

or representation of a real system, idea, or object. Models capture the most important fea-  
tures of a problem and present them in a form that is easy to interpret. A model can be as   
simple as a written or verbal description of some phenomenon, a visual representation such   
as a graph or a flowchart, or a mathematical or spreadsheet representation. [Example 1.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#47)illustrates three ways to express a model.

**decision model**

is a logical or mathematical representation of a problem or business

models can be represented in various ways, most typically with mathematical functions and

of their versatility in managing data, evaluating different scenarios, and presenting results   
in a meaningful fashion. We will focus on spreadsheet models be[ginning with Chapter 11.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)

Decision models typically have three types of input:

**1.**

*Data*

, which are assumed to be constant for purposes of the model. Some exam-

ples are costs, machine capacities, and intercity distances.

**2.**

*Uncontrollable inputs*

, which are quantities that can change but cannot be

directly controlled by the decision maker. Some examples are customer demand,   
inflation rates, and investment returns. Often, these variables are uncertain.

**3.**

*Decision options*

, which are controllable and can be selected at the discre-

tion of the decision maker. Some examples are production quantities, staffing   
levels, and investment allocations. Decision options are often called

**decision**

**variables**

.

Decision models characterize the relationships among these inputs and the outputs

of interest to the decision maker (see [Figure 1.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#48)). In this way, the user can manipulate   
the decision options and understand how they influence outputs, make predictions for the   
future, or use analytical tools to find the best decisions. Thus, decision models can be   
descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive and therefore are used in a wide variety of business   
analytics applications.

EXAMPLE 1.2

Three Forms of a Model

Models are usually developed from theory or observation   
and establish relationships between actions that decision   
makers might take and results that they might expect,   
thereby allowing the decision makers to evaluate scenarios   
or to predict what might happen. For example, the sales   
of a new product, such as a first-generation iPad, Android   
phone, or 3-D television, often follow a common pattern.   
We might represent this in one of the three following ways:

1.

A simple verbal description of sales might be:

The rate

of sales starts small as early adopters begin to evaluate

a new product and then begins to grow at an increasing

rate over time as positive customer feedback spreads.

Eventually, the market begins to become saturated, and

the rate of sales begins to decrease.

2.

A sketch of sales as an S-shaped curve over time, as   
[shown in Figure 1.2, is a visual model that conveys this](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#47)phenomenon.

3.

Finally, analysts might identify a mathematical model   
that characterizes this curve. Several different math-  
ematical functions do this; one is called a Gom-  
pertz curve and has the formula:

S

=

ae

be

ct

, where

S

=

sales,

t

=

time

,

e

is the base of natural logarithms,

and

a

,

b

, and

c

are constants. Of course, you would not

be expected to know this; that's what analytics profes-  
sionals do.

Decision models complement decision makers' intuition and often provide insights

that intuition cannot. For example, one early application of analytics in marketing involved   
a study of sales operations. Sales representatives had to divide their time between large   
and small customers and between acquiring new customers and keeping old ones. The   
problem was to determine how the representatives should best allocate their time. Intuition   
suggested that they should concentrate on large customers and that it was much harder to   
acquire a new customer than to keep an old one. However, intuition could not tell whether   
they should concentrate on the 100 largest or the 1,000 largest customers, or how much   
effort to spend on acquiring new customers. Models of sales force effectiveness and cus-  
tomer response patterns provided the insight to make these decisions. However, it is impor-  
tant to understand that all models are only representations of the real world and, as such,   
cannot capture every nuance that decision makers face in reality. Decision makers must   
often modify the policies that models suggest to account for intangible factors that they   
might not have been able to incorporate into the model.

[Descriptive Models](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Descriptive models explain behavior and allow users to evaluate potential decisions by   
asking "what-if?" questions. The following example illustrates a simple descriptive math-  
ematical model.

EXAMPLE 1.3

Gasoline Usage Model

Automobiles have different fuel economies (miles per gal-  
lon), and commuters drive different distances to work or   
school. Suppose that a state Department of Transportation   
(DOT) is interested in measuring the average monthly fuel   
consumption of commuters in a certain city. The DOT might   
sample a group of commuters and collect information on the   
number of miles driven per day, the number of driving days   
per month, the fuel economy of their vehicles, and additional   
miles driven per month for leisure and household activities.   
We may develop a simple descriptive model for calculating   
the amount of gasoline consumed, using the following sym-  
bols for the data:

G

=

gallons of fuel consumed per month

m

=

miles driven per day to and from work or school

d

=

number of driving days per month

f

=

fuel economy in miles per gallon (mpg)

a

=

additional miles for leisure and household activities

per month

When developing mathematical models, it is very

important to use the dimensions of the variables to ensure   
logical consistency. In this example, we see that

(

m

miles/day)

\*

(

d

days/month)

=

m

\*

d

miles/month

Thus, the total number of miles driven per month

=

m

\*

d

+

a

. If the vehicle gets

f

miles/gallon, then the total number

of gallons consumed per month is

G

=

(

m

\*

d

+

a

miles/month)/(

f

miles/gallon)

=

(

m

\*

d

+

a

)/

f

gallons/month

(1.1)

Suppose that a commuter drives 30 miles round trip to work   
for 20 days each month, achieves a fuel economy of 34 mpg,   
and drives an additional 250 miles each month. Using for-  
[mula (1.1), the number of gallons consumed is](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#48)

Chapter 1

Introduction to Business Analytics

In the previous example, we have no decision options; the model is purely descriptive,

but allows us to evaluate "what-if?" questions, for example, "What if we purchase a hybrid   
vehicle with a fuel economy of 45 miles/gallon?" "What if leisure and household activ-  
ity driving increases to 400 miles/month?" Most of the models we will be using include   
decision options. As an example, suppose that a manufacturer has the option of producing   
a part in house or outsourcing it from a supplier (the decision options). Should the firm   
produce the part or outsource it? The decision depends on the costs of manufacturing and   
outsourcing, as well as the anticipated volume of demand (the uncontrollable inputs). By   
developing a model to evaluate the total cost of both alternatives (the outputs), the best   
decision can be made.

EXAMPLE 1.4

An Outsourcing Decision Model

Suppose that a manufacturer can produce a part for

$125/unit with a fixed cost of $50,000. The alternative is to   
outsource production to a supplier at a unit cost of $175.   
The total manufacturing and outsourcing costs can be   
expressed by simple mathematical formulas, where

Q

is the

production volume:

TC

(manufacturing)

=

$

50,000

+

$

125

\*

Q

(1.2)

TC

(outsourcing)

=

$

175

\*

Q

(1.3)

These formulas comprise the decision model,

which simply describes what the costs of manu-  
facturing and outsourcing are for any level of pro-  
duction volume. Thus, if the anticipated production   
volume is 1,500 units, the cost of manufacturing will be

$

50,000

+

$

125

\*

1,500

=

$

237,500, and the cost

of outsourcing would be

$

175

\*

1,500

=

$

262,500;

therefore, manufacturing would be the best decision.   
On the other hand, if the anticipated production vol-  
ume is only 800 units, the cost of manufacturing will be

$

50,000

+

$

125

\*

800

=

$

150,000 and the cost of out-

sourcing would be

$

175

\*

800

=

$

140,000, and the

best decision would be to outsource. If we graph the   
two total cost formulas, we can easily see how the costs   
compare for different values of

Q

. This is shown graphi-

cally in [Figure 1.4.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#49) The point at which the total costs of   
manufacturing and outsourcing are equal is called the   
break-even volume. This can easily be found by setting

TC

(outsourcing) and solving for

Predictive models focus on what will happen in the future. Many predictive models are   
developed by analyzing historical data and assuming that the past is representative of the   
future.[Example 1.5](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#50) shows how historical data might be used to develop a model that can be   
used to predict the impact of pricing and promotional strategies in the grocery industry.

EXAMPLE 1.5

A Predictive Sales-Promotion Model

In the grocery industry, managers typically need to know   
how best to use pricing, coupons, and advertising strate-  
gies to influence sales. Grocers often study the relationship   
of sales volume to these strategies by conducting con-  
trolled experiments. That is, they implement different com-  
binations of pricing, coupons, and advertising, observe the

sales that result, and use analytics to develop predictive   
models of sales as a function of these decision strategies.

For example, suppose that a grocer who operates

three stores in a small city varied the price, coupons   
(yes

=

1, no

=

0), and advertising expenditures in a local

newspaper over a 16-week period and observed the fol-  
lowing sales:

To better understand the relationships among price,

coupons, and advertising, an analyst might have developed   
the following model using business analytics tools (we will   
[see how to do this in Chapter 8):](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#312)

In this example, the uncontrollable inputs are the sales at   
each store. The decision options are price, coupons, and   
advertising. The numerical values in the model are estimated   
from the data obtained from the experiment. They reflect   
the impact on sales of changing the decision options. For   
example, an increase in price of $1 results in a 56.18-unit

[Prescriptive Models](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

A prescriptive decision model helps decision makers to identify the best solution to a deci-  
sion problem.

**Optimization**

is the process of finding a set of values for decision options

that minimize or maximize some quantity of interest---profit, revenue, cost, time, and so   
on---called the

**objective function**

. Any set of decision options that optimizes the objective

function is called an

**optimal solution**

. In a highly competitive world, where one percent-

age point can mean a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, knowing the   
best solution can mean the difference between success and failure.

increase in weekly sales; using coupons (that is, setting   
Coupon

=

1 in the model) results in a 123.88-unit increase

in weekly sales. The output of the model is the predicted   
total sales units of the product. For example, if the price is   
$6.99, no coupons are offered, and no advertising is done   
(the experiment corresponding to week 1), the model esti-  
mates sales as

Total Sales

=

1,105.55

+

56.18

\*

6.99

+

123.88

\*

0

+

5.24

\*

0

=

1,498.25 units

We see that the actual total sales in the three stores for   
week 1 was 1,492. Thus, this model appears to provide   
good estimates for sales using the historical data. We would   
hope that this model would also provide good predictions   
of future sales. So if the grocer decides to set the price at   
$5.99, does not use coupons, and spends $100 in advertis-  
ing, the model would predict sales to be

Total Sales

=

1,105.55

+

56.18

\*

5.99

+

123.88

\*

0

+

5.24

\*

100

=

1,966.07 units

Although the pricing model did not, most optimization models have

**constraints**

---

limitations, requirements, or other restrictions that are imposed on any solution, such as   
"Do not exceed the allowable budget" or "Ensure that all demand is met." For instance, a   
consumer products company manager would probably want to ensure that a specified level   
of customer service is achieved with the redesign of the distribution system. The presence   
of constraints makes modeling and solving optimization problems more challenging; we   
address constrained optimization problems l[ater in this book, starting in Chapter 13.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494)

For some prescriptive models, analytical solutions---closed-form mathematical

expressions or simple formulas---can be obtained using such techniques as calculus or   
other types of mathematical analyses. In most cases, however, some type of computer-  
based procedure is needed to find an optimal solution. An

**algorithm**

is a systematic pro-

cedure that finds a solution to a problem. Researchers have developed effective algorithms   
to solve many types of optimization problems. For example, Microsoft Excel has a built-in   
add-in called

*Solver*

that allows you to find optimal solutions to optimization problems

formulated as spreadsheet models. We use

*Solver*

in later chapters. However, we will not

be concerned with the detailed mechanics of these algorithms; our focus will be on the use   
of the algorithms to solve and analyze the models we develop.

EXAMPLE 1.6

A Prescriptive Model for Pricing

To illustrate an example of a prescriptive model, suppose   
that a firm wishes to determine the best pricing for one of its   
products to maximize revenue over the next year. A market   
research study has collected data that estimate the expected   
annual sales for different levels of pricing. Analysts deter-  
mined that sales can be expressed by the following model:

Sales

=

-

2.9485

\*

Price

+

3,240.9

(1.5)

Because revenue equals price

\*

sales

,

a model for total rev-

enue is

Total Revenue

=

Price

\*

Sales

=

Price

\*

(

-

2.9485

\*

Price

+

3,240.9)

=

-

2.9485

\*

Price

2

+

3,240.9

\*

Price

(1.6)

The firm would like to identify the price that maximizes the   
total revenue. One way to do this would be to try different   
prices and search for the one that yields the highest total   
revenue. This would be quite tedious to do by hand or even   
with a calculator; however, as we will see in later chapters,   
spreadsheet models make this much easier.

Chapter 1

23

If possible, we would like to ensure that an algorithm such as the one

*Solver*

uses finds

the best solution. However, some models are so complex that it is impossible to solve them   
optimally in a reasonable amount of computer time because of the extremely large number   
of computations that may be required or because they are so complex that finding the best   
solution cannot be guaranteed. In these cases, analysts use

**search algorithms**

---solution

procedures that generally find good solutions without guarantees of finding the best one.   
Powerful search algorithms exist to obtain good solutions to extremely difficult optimiza-  
tion problems. One of these is discussed in Chapter 14.

[Model Assumptions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

All models are based on assumptions that reflect the modeler's view of the "real world." Some   
assumptions are made to simplify the model and make it more tractable, that is, able to be   
easily analyzed or solved. Other assumptions might be made to better characterize historical   
data or past observations. The task of the modeler is to select or build an appropriate model   
that best represents the behavior of the real situation. For example, economic theory tells us   
that demand for a product is negatively related to its price. Thus, as prices increase, demand   
falls, and vice versa (a phenomenon that you may recognize as price elasticity---the ratio of   
the percentage change in demand to the percentage change in price). Different mathematical   
models can describe this phenomenon. In the following examples, we illustrate two of them.

EXAMPLE 1.7

A Linear Demand Prediction Model

A simple model to predict demand as a function of price is   
the linear model

D

=

a

-

bP

(1.7)

where

D

is the demand,

P

is the unit price,

a

is a constant

that estimates the demand when the price is zero, and

b

is the

slope of the demand function. This model is most applicable   
when we want to predict the effect of small changes around   
the current price. For example, suppose we know that when   
the price is $100, demand is 19,000 units and that demand   
falls by 10 for each dollar of price increase. Using simple alge-  
bra, we can determine that

a

=

20,000 and

b

=

10. Thus, if

the price is $80, the predicted demand is

D

=

20,000

-

10(80)

=

19,200 units

If the price increases to $90, the model predicts demand as

D

=

20,000

-

10(90)

=

19,100 units

If the price is $100, demand would be

D

=

20,000

-

10(100)

=

19,000 units

and so on. A graph of demand as a function of price is   
[shown in Figure 1.5 as price varies between $80 and $120.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#52)We see that there is a constant decrease in demand for each   
$10 increase in price, a characteristic of a linear model.

ent prices (other than $90). Which model is best? The answer may be neither. First of all,   
the development of realistic models requires many price point changes within a carefully   
designed experiment. Second, it should also include data on competition and customer   
disposable income, both of which are hard to determine. Nevertheless, it is possible to   
develop price elasticity models with limited price ranges and narrow customer segments.   
A good starting point would be to create a historical database with detailed information on   
all past pricing actions. Unfortunately, practitioners have observed that such models are   
not widely used in retail marketing, suggesting ample opportunity to apply business   
analytics.

Using these values in [equation (1.8),](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#53) we can deter-

mine the value for

d

as 0.0111382 (we can do this math-

ematically using logarithms, but we'll see how to do this   
very easily using Excel [in Chapter 11). Thus, if the price](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)is   
$80, then the predicted demand is

D

=

20,000(80)

-

0.0111382

=

19,047

If the price is 90, the demand would be

D

=

20,000(90)

-

0.0111382

=

19,022

If the price is 100, demand is

D

=

20,000(100)

-

0.0111382

=

19,000

A graph of demand as a function of price is shown in   
[Figure 1.6.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#53) The predicted demand falls in a slight nonlinear   
fashion as price increases. For example, demand decreases   
by 25 units when the price increases from $80 to $90, but   
only by 22 units when the price increases from $90 to $100.   
If the price increases to $110, you would see a smaller   
decrease in demand. Therefore, we see a nonlinear relation-

[Uncertainty and Risk](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

As we all know, the future is always uncertain. Thus, many predictive models incorporate   
uncertainty and help decision makers analyze the risks associated with their decisions.

**Uncertainty**

is imperfect knowledge of what will happen;

**risk**

is associated with the con-

sequences and likelihood of what might happen. For example, the change in the stock price   
of Apple on the next day of trading is uncertain. If you own Apple stock, then you face the   
risk of losing money if the stock price falls. If you don't own any stock, the price is still   
uncertain, although you would not have any risk. Risk is evaluated by the magnitude of the   
consequences and the likelihood that they would occur. For example, a 10% drop in a stock   
price would incur a higher risk if you own $1 million worth of that stock than if you only   
owned $1,000 worth of that stock. Similarly, if the chances of a 10% drop were 1 in 5, the   
risk would be higher than if the chances were only 1 in 100.

The importance of risk in business has long been recognized. The renowned manage-

ment writer Peter Drucker observed in 1974:

*To try to eliminate risk in business enterprise is futile. Risk is inherent in the commit-
ment of present resources to future expectations. Indeed, economic progress can be
defined as the ability to take greater risks. The attempt to eliminate risks, even the
attempt to minimize them, can only make them irrational and unbearable. It can only
result in the greatest risk of all: rigidity.*

29

Consideration of risk is a vital element of decision making. For instance, you would prob-

ably not choose an investment simply on the basis of the return you might expect because,   
typically, higher returns are associated with higher risk. Therefore, you have to make a trade-  
off between the benefits of greater rewards and the risks of potential losses. Analytic models   
can help assess risk. A model in which some of the model input information is uncertain is   
often called a

**stochastic**

, or

**probabilistic**

,

**model**

. In contrast, a

**deterministic model**

is one

in which all model input information is either known or assumed to be known with certainty.   
For instance, suppose that customer demand is an important element of some model. We can   
make the assumption that the demand is known with certainty; say, 5,000 units per month.   
In this case, we would be dealing with a deterministic model. On the other hand, suppose we   
have evidence to indicate that demand is uncertain, with an average value of 5,000 units per   
month, but which typically varies between 3,200 and 6,800 units. If we make this assump-  
tion, we would be dealing with a stochastic model. Stochastic models are useful in analyzing   
uncertainty in real-world situations, and we will discuss these later in this book.

Introduction to Business Analytics

[Problem Solving with Analytics](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

The fundamental purpose of analytics is to help managers solve problems and make deci-  
sions. The techniques of analytics represent only a portion of the overall problem-solving   
and decision-making process. Problem solving is the activity associated with defining, ana-  
lyzing, and solving a problem and selecting an appropriate solution that solves a problem.

**Problem solving**

consists of several phases:

**1.**

Recognizing a problem

**2.**

Defining the problem

**3.**

Structuring the problem

**4.**

Analyzing the problem

**5.**

Interpreting results and making a decision

**6.**

Implementing the solution

[Recognizing a Problem](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Managers at different organizational levels face different types of problems. In a manu-  
facturing firm, for instance, top managers face decisions regarding allocating financial   
resources, building or expanding facilities, determining product mix, and strategically   
sourcing production. Middle managers in operations develop distribution plans, production   
and inventory schedules, and staffing plans. Finance managers analyze risks, determine   
investment strategies, and make pricing decisions. Marketing managers develop advertis-  
ing plans and make sales force allocation decisions. In manufacturing operations, prob-  
lems involve the size of daily production runs, individual machine schedules, and worker   
assignments. Whatever the problem, the first step is to realize that it exists.

How are problems recognized? Problems exist when there is a gap between what is

happening and what we think should be happening. For example, a consumer products   
manager might feel that distribution costs are too high. This recognition might result from   
comparing performance with that of a competitor, or observing an increasing trend com-  
pared to previous years.

[Defining the Problem](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

The second step in the problem-solving process is to clearly define the problem. Finding   
the real problem and distinguishing it from symptoms that are observed is a critical step.   
For example, high distribution costs might stem from inefficiencies in routing trucks, poor   
location of distribution centers, or external factors such as increasing fuel costs. The prob-  
lem might be defined as improving the routing process, redesigning the entire distribution   
system, or optimally hedging fuel purchases.

Defining problems is not a trivial task. The complexity of a problem increases when

the following occur:

■

■

The number of potential courses of action is large.

■

■

The problem belongs to a group rather than to an individual.

■

■

The problem solver has several competing objectives.

■

■

External groups or individuals are affected by the problem.

■

■

The problem solver and the true owner of the problem---the person who experi-  
ences the problem and is responsible for getting it solved---are not the same.

■

■

Time limitations are important.

These factors make it difficult to develop meaningful objectives and characterize the range   
of potential decisions. In defining problems, it is important to involve all people who make   
the decisions or who may be affected by them.

[Structuring the Problem](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

This usually involves stating goals and objectives, characterizing the possible decisions,   
and identifying any constraints or restrictions. For example, if the problem is to redesign   
a distribution system, decisions might involve new locations for manufacturing plants and   
warehouses (where?), new assignments of products to plants (which ones?), and the amount   
of each product to ship from different warehouses to customers (how much?). The goal of   
cost reduction might be measured by the total delivered cost of the product. The manager   
would probably want to ensure that a specified level of customer service---for instance,   
being able to deliver orders within 48 hours---is achieved with the redesign. This is an   
example of a constraint. Structuring a problem often involves developing a formal model.

[Analyzing the Problem](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Here is where analytics plays a major role. Analysis involves some sort of experimentation   
or solution process, such as evaluating different scenarios, analyzing risks associated with   
various decision alternatives, finding a solution that meets certain goals, or determining   
an optimal solution. Analytics professionals have spent decades developing and refining a   
variety of approaches to address different types of problems. Much of this book is devoted   
to helping you understand these techniques and gain a basic facility in using them.

[Interpreting Results and Making a Decision](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Interpreting the results from the analysis phase is crucial in making good decisions. Mod-  
els cannot capture every detail of the real problem, and managers must understand the   
limitations of models and their underlying assumptions and often incorporate judgment   
into making a decision. For example, in locating a facility, we might use an analytical pro-  
cedure to find a "central" location; however, many other considerations must be included   
in the decision, such as highway access, labor supply, and facility cost. Thus, the location   
specified by an analytical solution might not be the exact location the company actually   
chooses.

[Implementing the Solution](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

This simply means making the solution work in the organization, or translating the results   
of a model back to the real world. This generally requires providing adequate resources,   
motivating employees, eliminating resistance to change, modifying organizational policies,   
and developing trust. Problems and their solutions affect people: customers, suppliers, and   
employees. All must be an important part of the problem-solving process. Sensitivity to   
political and organizational issues is an important skill that managers and analytical pro-  
fessionals alike must possess when solving problems.

In each of these steps, good communication is vital. Analytics professionals need to be

able to communicate with managers and clients to understand the business context of the   
problem and be able to explain results clearly and effectively. Such skills as constructing   
good visual charts and spreadsheets that are easy to understand are vital to users of analyt-  
ics. We emphasize these skills throughout this book.

What lessons did Hewlett-Packard learn about using analytics?

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Hewlett-Packard (HP) uses analytics extensively. Many   
applications are used by managers with little knowledge   
of analytics. These require that analytical tools be easily   
understood. Based on years of experience, HP analysts   
compiled some key lessons. Before creating an analytical   
decision tool, HP asks three questions:

1.

Will analytics solve the problem?

Will the tool enable

a better solution? Should other, nonanalytical solu-  
tions be used? Are there organizational or other issues   
that must be resolved? Often, what may appear to be   
an analytical problem may actually be rooted in prob-  
lems of incentive misalignment, unclear ownership and   
accountability, or business strategy.

2.

Can we leverage an existing solution?

Before "rein-

venting the wheel," can existing solutions address the   
problem? What are the costs and benefits?

3.

Is a decision model really needed?

Can simple decision

guidelines be used instead of a formal decision tool?

Once a decision is made to develop an analytical

tool, several guidelines are used to increase the chances   
of successful implementation:

■

■

Use prototyping

, a quick working version of the tool

designed to test its features and gather feedback.

■

■

Build insight, not black boxes.

A "black box" tool is one

that generates an answer, but may not provide confi-  
dence to the user. Interactive tools that create insights   
to support a decision provide better information.

■

■

Remove unneeded complexity.

Simpler is better.

A good tool can be used without expert support.

makers who will actually use the tool should be involved

What Is Business Analytics?

1.

Discuss how you might use business analytics in   
your personal life, such as in managing your grocery   
purchasing, automobile maintenance, budgeting, or   
sports. Be creative in identifying opportunities!

2.

How might analytics be used in the following situations?

a.

Making and marketing a new product

b.

Deciding where to locate a new plant

c.

Determining a personal investment plan

3.

A supermarket has been experiencing long lines dur-  
ing peak periods of the day. The problem is notice-  
ably worse on certain days of the week, and the peak   
periods sometimes differ according to the day of the   
week. There are usually enough workers on the job   
to open all cash registers. The problem the supermar-  
ket manager faces is knowing when to call some of   
the workers who are stocking shelves up to the front   
to work the checkout counters. How might business   
analytics help the supermarket manager? What data   
would be needed to facilitate good decisions?

Models in Business Analytics

5.

Suppose that a manufacturer can produce a part for   
$10.00 with a fixed cost of $5,000. Alternately, the   
manufacturer could contract with a supplier in Asia to   
purchase the part at a cost of $12.00, which includes   
transportation.

a.

If the anticipated production volume is   
1,200 units, compute the total cost of manufactur-  
ing and the total cost of outsourcing.

b.

What is the best decision?

6.

Use the model developed in [Example 1.5](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#50)to pre-  
dict the total sales for weeks 2 through 16, and   
compare the results to the observed sales. Does the   
accuracy of the model seem to be different when   
coupons are used or not? When advertising is used   
or not?

[CASE: PERFORMANCE LAWN EQUIPMENT](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

In each chapter of this book, we use a a fictitious com-  
pany, Performance Lawn Equipment (PLE), within a case   
exercise for applying the tools and techniques introduced   
in the chapter.

31

To put the case in perspective, we first

provide some background about the company, so that   
the applications of business analytic tools will be more   
meaningful.

PLE, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a privately

owned designer and producer of traditional lawn mowers   
used by homeowners. In the past ten years, PLE has added   
another key product, a medium-size diesel power lawn trac-  
tor with front and rear power takeoffs, Class I three-point   
hitches, four-wheel drive, power steering, and full hydrau-  
lics. This equipment is built primarily for a niche market   
consisting of large estates, including golf and country clubs,   
resorts, private estates, city parks, large commercial com-  
plexes, lawn care service providers, private homeowners   
with five or more acres, and government (federal, state, and   
local) parks, building complexes, and military bases. PLE   
provides most of the products to dealerships, which, in turn,   
sell directly to end users. PLE employs 1,660 people world-  
wide. About half the workforce is based in St. Louis; the   
remainder is split among their manufacturing plants.

In the United States, the focus of sales is on the east-

ern seaboard, California, the Southeast, and the south   
central states, which have the greatest concentration of   
customers. Outside the United States, PLE's sales include   
a European market, a growing South American market,   
and developing markets in the Pacific Rim and China.

Both end users and dealers have been established as

important customers for PLE. Collection and analysis of   
end-user data showed that satisfaction with the products   
depends on high quality, easy attachment/dismount of   
implements, low maintenance, price value, and service.

For dealers, key requirements are high quality, parts and   
feature availability, rapid restock, discounts, and timeli-  
ness of support.

PLE has several key suppliers: Mitsitsiu, Inc., the

sole source of all diesel engines; LANTO Axles, Inc.,   
which provides tractor axles; Schorst Fabrication, which   
provides subassemblies; Cuberillo, Inc, supplier of trans-  
missions; and Specialty Machining, Inc., a supplier of   
precision machine parts.

To help manage the company, PLE managers have

developed a "balanced scorecard" of measures. These   
data, which are summarized shortly, are stored in the   
form of a Microsoft Excel workbook (

*Performance Lawn*

*Equipment*

) accompanying this book. The database con-

tains various measures captured on a monthly or quar-  
terly basis and is used by various managers to evaluate   
business performance. Data for each of the key measures   
are stored in a separate worksheet. A summary of these   
worksheets is given next:

■

■

*Dealer Satisfaction*

, measured on a scale of 1--5

(1

=

poor, 2

=

less than average, 3

=

average,

4

=

above average, and 5

=

excellent). Each year,

dealers in each region are surveyed about their overall   
satisfaction with PLE. The worksheet contains sum-  
mary data from surveys for the past five years.

■

■

*End-User Satisfaction*

, measured on the same scale

as dealers. Each year, 100 users from each region are   
surveyed. The worksheet contains summary data for   
the past five years.

■

■

*Customer Survey*

, results from a survey for customer rat-

ings of specific attributes of PLE tractors: quality, ease   
of use, price, and service on the same 1--5 scale. This   
sheet contains 200 observations of customer ratings.

31

The case scenario was based on

*Gateway Estate Lawn Equipment Co. Case Study*

, used for the 1997 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality

Award Examiner Training course. This material is in the public domain. The database, however, was developed by the author.

Problem Solving with Analytics

11.

In this chapter, we noted the importance of defining   
and analyzing a problem prior to attempting to find   
a solution. Consider this example: One of the earli-  
est operations research groups during World War II   
was conducting a study on the optimum utilization   
of Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft during the Battle of   
Britain. Whenever one of these planes returned from   
battle, the locations of the bullet holes on it were   
carefully plotted. By repeatedly recording these data   
over time, and studying the clusters of data, the group

was able to estimate the regions of the aircraft most   
likely to be hit by enemy gunfire, with the objective   
of reinforcing these regions with special armor. What   
difficulties do you see here?

12.

John Toczek, a practicing analytics professional,   
maintains a Web site called the PuzzlOR (OR stand-  
ing for "operations research") at[www.puzzlor.com.](http://www.puzzlor.com/)   
Each month he posts a new puzzle. Choose one of   
them and work through the problem-solving process,   
focusing on steps two through four. A good one to   
start with is "SurvivOR" from June 2010.

Chapter 1

Introduction to Business Analytics

■

■

*Complaints*

, which shows the number of complaints

registered by all customers each month in each of   
PLE's five regions (North America, South America,   
Europe, the Pacific, and China).

■

■

*Mower Unit Sales*

and

*Tractor Unit Sales*

, which pro-

vide sales by product by region on a monthly basis.   
Unit sales for each region are aggregated to obtain   
world sales figures.

■

■

*Industry Mower Total Sales*

and

*Industry Tractor*

*Total Sales*

, which list the number of units sold by all

producers by region.

■

■

*Unit Production Costs*

, which provides monthly account-

ing estimates of the variable cost per unit for manufactur-  
ing tractors and mowers over the past five years.

■

■

*Operating and Interest Expenses*

, which provides

monthly administrative, depreciation, and interest   
expenses at the corporate level.

■

■

*On-Time Delivery*

, which provides the number of

deliveries made each month from each of PLE's major   
suppliers, the number on time, and the percent on time.

■

■

*Defects After Delivery*

, which shows the number of

defects in supplier-provided material found in all ship-  
ments received from suppliers.

■

■

*Time to Pay Suppliers*

, which provides measurements

in days from the time the invoice is received until pay-  
ment is sent.

■

■

*Response Time*

, which gives samples of the times

taken by PLE customer-service personnel to respond   
to service calls by quarter over the past two years.

■

■

*Employee Satisfaction*

, which provides data for the

past four years of internal surveys of employees to   
determine their overall satisfaction with their jobs,   
using the same scale used for customers. Employees   
are surveyed quarterly, and results are stratified by   
employee category: design and production, manage-  
rial, and sales/administrative support.

In addition to these business measures, the PLE data-

base contains worksheets with data from special studies:

■

■

*Engines*

, which lists 50 samples of the time required to

produce a lawn mower blade using a new technology.

■

■

*Transmission Costs*

, which provides the results of

30 samples each for the current process used to pro-  
duce tractor transmissions and two proposed new   
processes.

■

■

*Blade Weight*

, which provides samples of mower

blade weights to evaluate the consistency of the pro-  
duction process.

■

■

*Mower Test*

, which lists test results of mower func-

tional performance after assembly for 30 samples of   
100 units each.

■

■

*Employee Retention*

, data from a study of employee

duration (length of hire) with PLE. The 40 subjects   
were identified by reviewing hires from ten years   
prior and identifying those who were involved in   
managerial positions (either hired into management or   
promoted into management) at some time in this ten-  
year period.

■

■

*Shipping Cost*

, which gives the unit shipping cost

for mowers and tractors from existing and proposed   
plants for a supply chain design study.

■

■

*Fixed Cost*

, which lists the fixed cost to expand exist-

ing plants or build new facilities, also as part of the   
supply chain design study.

■

■

*Purchasing Survey*

, which provides data obtained

from a third-party survey of purchasing managers of   
customers of Performance Lawn Care.

Elizabeth Burke has recently joined the PLE man-

agement team to oversee production operations. She has   
reviewed the types of data that the company collects and   
has assigned you the responsibility to be her chief analyst   
in the coming weeks. She has asked you to do some pre-  
liminary analysis of the data for the company.

**1.**

First, she would like you to edit the worksheets

*Dealer*

*Satisfaction*

and

*End-User Satisfaction*

to display the

total number of responses to each level of the survey   
scale across all regions for each year.

**2.**

Second, she wants a count of the number of failures in   
the worksheet

*Mower Test*

.

**3.**

Next, Elizabeth has provided you with prices for PLE   
products for the past five years:

Year

Mower Price

Tractor Price

2014

$150

$3,250

2015

$175

$3,400

2016

$180

$3,600

2017

$185

$3,700

2018

$190

$3,800

Create a new worksheet to compute gross revenues   
by month and region, as well as worldwide totals, for   
each product using the data in

*Mower Unit Sales*

and

*Tractor Unit Sales*

.

**4.**

Finally, she wants to know the market share for each   
product and region by month based on the PLE and   
industry sales data, and the average market share by   
region over the five years.

Summarize all your findings in a report to Ms. Burke.

To be able to apply the procedures and techniques that you will learn in this book, it is nec-  
essary for you to be relatively proficient in using Excel. We assume that you are familiar   
with the most elementary spreadsheet concepts and procedures, such as

■

■

opening, saving, and printing files;

■

■

using workbooks and worksheets;

■

■

moving around a spreadsheet;

■

■

selecting cells and ranges;

■

■

inserting/deleting rows and columns;

■

■

entering and editing text, numerical data, and formulas in cells;

■

■

formatting data (number, currency, decimal places, etc.);

■

■

working with text strings;

■

■

formatting data and text; and

■

■

modifying the appearance of the spreadsheet using borders, shading, and so on.

Menus and commands in Excel reside in the "ribbon" sho[wn in Figure A1.1. All](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#62)Excel

discussions in this book will be based on Excel 2016 for Windows; if you use Excel 2016   
for Mac, some differences may exist, and we may point these out as appropriate. Menus   
and commands are arranged in logical

*groups*

under different

*tabs*

(

*Home, Insert,*

*Formu-*

*las,*

and so on); small triangles pointing downward indicate

*menus*

of additional choices.

We often refer to certain commands or options and where they may be found in the ribbon.   
For instance, in the Mac version, groups are not specified.

Excel provides an add-in called the

*Analysis Toolpak*

, which contains a variety of

tools for statistical computation, and

*Solver*

, which is used for optimization. They will be

found in the

*Data*

tab ribbon; you should ensure that these are activated. To activate them

in Windows, click the

*File*

tab and then

*Options*

in the left column. Choose

*Add-Ins*

from

the left column. At the bottom of the dialog, make sure

*Excel Add-ins*

is selected in the

*Manage:*

box and click

*Go*

. In the

*Add-Ins*

dialog, if

*Analysis Toolpak*

,

*Analysis Toolpak*

*VBA*

, and

*Solver Add-in*

are not checked, simply check the boxes and click

*OK*

. You will

not have to repeat this procedure every time you run Excel in the future. On Excel 2016 for   
Mac, go to

[Excel Formulas and Addressing](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Formulas in Excel use common mathematical operators:

■

■

addition (

+

)

■

■

subtraction (

-

)

■

■

multiplication (\*)

■

■

division (/)

Exponentiation uses the \^ symbol; for example, 2

5

is written as 2\^5 in an Excel formula.

Cell references in formulas can be written either with

*relative addresses*

or

*absolute*

*addresses*

. A

**relative address**

uses just the row and column label in the cell reference

(for example, A4 or C21); an

**absolute address**

uses a dollar sign ($ sign) before either the

row or column label or both (for example, $A2, C$21, or $B$15). Which one we choose   
makes a critical difference if you copy the cell formulas. If only relative addressing is used,   
then copying a formula to another cell changes the cell references by the number of rows   
or columns in the direction that the formula is copied. So, for instance, if we would use a   
formula in cell B8,

=

B4

-

B5\*A8, and copy it to cell C9 (one column to the right and one

row down), all the cell references are increased by one and the formula would be changed   
to

=

C5

-

C6\*B9.

Using a $ sign before a row label (for example, B$4) keeps the reference fixed to

row 4 but allows the column reference to change if the formula is copied to another cell.   
Similarly, using a $ sign before a column label (for example, $B4) keeps the reference to   
column B fixed but allows the row reference to change. Finally, using a $ sign before both   
the row and column labels (for example, $B$4) keeps the reference to cell B4 fixed no

and

[Figure A1.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#63)shows a spreadsheet (Excel file

Demand

Prediction Models

) for calculating demand for differ-

ent prices using each of these models. For example, to

calculate the demand in cell B8 for the linear model, we   
use the formula

=

$B$4

-

$B$5

\*

A8

To calculate the demand in cell E8 for the nonlinear model,   
we use the formula

=

$E$4

\*

Note how the absolute addresses are used so that as these   
formulas are copied down, the demand is computed correctly.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive064.png)

matter where the formula is copied. You should be very careful to use relative and absolute   
addressing appropriately in your models, especially when copying formulas.

[Copying Formulas](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Excel provides several ways of copying formulas to different cells. This is extremely   
useful in building decision models, because many models require replication of formulas   
for different periods of time, similar products, and so on. The easiest way is to select the   
cell with the formula to be copied, and then press Ctrl-C on your Windows keyboard or   
Command-C on a Mac, click on the cell you wish to copy to, and then press Ctrl-V in   
Windows or Command-V on a Mac. You may also enter a formula directly in a range of   
cells without copying and pasting by selecting the range, typing in the formula, and press-  
ing Ctrl-Enter in Windows or Command-Enter on a Mac.

To copy a formula from a single cell or range of cells down a column or across a row,

first select the cell or range, click and hold the mouse on the small square in the lower   
right-hand corner of the cell (the "fill handle"), and drag the formula to the "target" cells   
to which you wish to copy.

■

■

***Split Screen.***

You may split the worksheet horizontally and/or vertically to view

different parts of the worksheet at the same time. The vertical splitter bar is just   
to the right of the bottom scroll bar, and the horizontal splitter bar is just above   
the right-hand scroll bar. Position your cursor over one of these until it changes   
shape, click, and drag the splitter bar to the left or down.

■

■

***Column and Row Widths.***

Many times a cell contains a number that is too large

to display properly because the column width is too small. You may change the   
column width to fit the largest value or text string anywhere in the column by   
positioning the cursor to the right of the column label so that it changes to a cross   
with horizontal arrows and then double-clicking. You may also move the arrow to   
the left or right to manually change the column width. You may change the row   
heights in a similar fashion by moving the cursor below the row number label.   
This can be especially useful if you have a very long formula to display. To break   
a formula within a cell, position the cursor at the break point in the formula bar   
and press Alt-Enter.

■

■

***Displaying Formulas in Worksheets.***

Choose

*Show Formulas*

in the

*Formulas*

tab. You may also press Ctrl \~ in either Windows or Mac to toggle formulas   
on and off. You often need to change the column width to display the formulas   
properly.

■

■

***Displaying Grid Lines and Row and Column Headers for Printing.***

Check the

*Print*

boxes for gridlines and headings in the

*Sheet Options*

group under the

*Page*

*Layout*

tab. Note that the

*Print*

command can be found by clicking on the

*Office*

button in Windows or under the

*File*

menu in Mac.

■

■

***Filling a Range with a Series of Numbers.***

Suppose you want to build a work-

sheet for entering 100 data values. It would be tedious to have to enter the num-  
bers from 1 to 100 one at a time. Simply fill in the first few values in the series   
and highlight them. Then click and drag the small square (fill handle) in the lower   
right-hand corner down (Excel will show a small pop-up window that tells you   
the last value in the range) until you have filled in the column to 100; then release   
the mouse.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive065.png)

Functions are used to perform special calculations in cells and are used extensively in busi-  
ness analytics applications. All Excel functions require an equal sign and a function name   
followed by parentheses, in which you specify arguments for the function.

[Basic Excel Functions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Some of the more common functions that we will use in applications include the following:

MIN(

*range*

)---finds the smallest value in a range of cells

MAX(

*range*

)---finds the largest value in a range of cells

SUM(

*range*

)---finds the sum of values in a range of cells

AVERAGE(

*range*

)---finds the average of the values in a range of cells

COUNT(

*range*

)---finds the number of cells in a range that contain numbers

COUNTIF(

*range, criteria*

)---finds the number of cells within a range that meet a

specified criterion

Logical functions, such as IF, AND, OR, and [VLOOKUP will be discussed in Chapter 2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#76)

The COUNTIF function counts the number of cells within a range that meet a crite-

rion you specify. For example, you can count all the cells that start with a certain letter, or   
you can count all the cells that contain a number that is larger or smaller than a number you   
specify. Examples of criteria are 100, "

7

100", a cell reference such as A4, and a text string

such as "Facebook." Note that text and logical formulas must be enclosed in quotes. See   
Excel Help for other examples.

Excel has other useful COUNT-type functions: COUNTA counts the number of non-

blank cells in a range, and COUNTBLANK counts the number of blank cells in a range. In   
addition, COUNTIFS(

*range1, criterion1, range2, criterion2, . . . , range_n, criterion_n*

)

finds the number of cells within multiple ranges that meet specific criteria for each range.

We illustrate these functions using the

*Purchase Orders*

[data set in Example A1.2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#65)

EXAMPLE A1.2

Using Basic Excel Functions

In the

Purchase Orders

data set, we will find the following:

■

■

Smallest and largest quantity of any item ordered

■

■

Total order costs

■

■

Average number of months per order for accounts payable

■

■

Number of purchase orders placed

■

■

Number of orders placed for O-rings

■

■

Number of orders with A/P (accounts payable) terms   
shorter than 30 months

■

■

Number of O-ring orders from Spacetime Technologies

■

■

Total cost of all airframe fasteners

■

■

Total cost of airframe fasteners purchased from Alum   
Sheeting

The results are shown in[Figure A1.3.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#66) In this figure, we   
used the split-screen feature in Excel to reduce the num-  
ber of rows shown in the spreadsheet. To find the small-  
est and largest quantity of any item ordered, we use the   
MIN and MAX functions for the data in column F. Thus,   
the formula in cell B99 is

=

MIN(F4:F97) and the formula in

cell B100 is

=

MAX(F4:F97). To find the total order costs,

we sum the data in column G using the SUM function:

=

SUM(G4:G97); this is the formula in cell B101. To find the

average number of A/P months, we use the AVERAGE func-  
tion for the data in column H. The formula in cell B102 is

=

AVERAGE(H4:H97). To find the number of purchase orders

placed, use the COUNT function. Note that the COUNT   
function counts only the number of cells in a range that con-  
tain numbers, so we could not use it in columns A, B, or   
D; however, any other column would be acceptable. Using   
the item numbers in column C, the formula in cell B103 is

=

COUNT(C4:C97). To find the number of orders placed for

O-rings, we use the COUNTIF function. For this example, the   
formula used in cell B104 is

=

COUNTIF(D4:D97,

"

O

@

Ring

"

).

We could have also used the cell reference for any cell con-  
taining the text O-Ring, such as

=

COUNTIF(D4:D97, D12).

To find the number of orders with A/P terms less than 30   
months, we use the formula

=

COUNTIF(H4:H97,

"

6

30

"

) in

cell B105. Finally, to count the number of O-ring orders for   
Spacetime Technologies, we use

=

COUNTIFS(D4:D97,

"

O-

Ring

"

, A4:A97,

"

Spacetime Technologies

"

).  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive066.png)

Appendix A1

37

IF-type functions are also available for other calculations. For example, the functions

SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, SUMIFS, and AVERAGEIFS can be used to embed IF logic within   
mathematical functions. For instance, the syntax of SUMIF is SUMIF(

*range, criterion,*

*\[sum range\]*

);

*sum range*

is an optional argument that allows you to add cells in a different

range. Thus, in the

*Purchase Orders*

database, to find the total cost of all airframe fasteners,

we would use

=

SUMIF(D4:D97, "Airframe fasteners", G4:G97)

This function looks for airframe fasteners in the range D4:D97, but then sums the associ-  
ated values in column G (cost per order). The arguments for SUMIFS and AVERAGEIFS   
are

*(sumrange, range1, criterion1, range2, criterion2, . . . ,rangeN, criterionN).*

For exam-

ple, the function

=

SUMIFS(F4:F97,A4:A97,"Alum Sheeting", D4:D97, "Airframe fasteners")

will find the total quantity (from the

*sumrange*

in column F) of all airframe fasteners pur-

chased from Alum Sheeting.

[Functions for Specific Applications](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Excel has a wide variety of other functions for statistical, financial, and other applications,   
many of which we introduce and use throughout the text. For instance, some financial   
models that we develop require the calculation of net present value (NPV).

**Net present**

A positive NPV means that the investment will provide

added value because the projected return exceeds the discount rate.

The Excel function NPV(

*rate, value1, value2, . . .*

) calculates the net present value of

an investment by using a discount rate and a series of future payments (negative values)   
and income (positive values).

*Rate*

is the value of the discount rate

*i*

over the length of

one period, and

*value1*

,

*value2*

, . . . are 1 to 29 arguments representing the payments and

income for each period. The values must be equally spaced in time and are assumed to   
occur at the end of each period. The NPV investment begins one period before the date   
of the

*value1*

cash flow and ends with the last cash flow in the list. The NPV calculation

is based on future cash flows. If the first cash flow (such as an initial investment or fixed   
cost) occurs at the beginning of the first period, then it must be added to the NPV result and

*not*

included in the function arguments.

EXAMPLE A1.3

Using the NPV Function

A company is introducing a new product. The fixed cost for   
marketing and distribution is $25,000 and is incurred just   
prior to launch. The forecasted net sales revenues for the   
first six months are shown in [Figure A1.4.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#67) The formula in

cell B8 computes the net present value of these cash flows   
as

=

NPV(B6, C4:H4)

-

B5. Note that the fixed cost is not

a future cash flow and is not included in the NPV function   
arguments.

This feature is particularly useful if you know what function to use but are not sure of

what arguments to enter because it will guide you in entering the appropriate data for the   
function arguments.[Figure A1.5](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#68)shows the dialog from which you may select the func-

[Date and Time Functions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

In many analytics applications, a database might contain dates, such as when an order is   
placed or when an employee was hired. Excel can display a date in a variety of formats, such   
as 2/14/17 or 14-Feb-17. You may choose the standard date format (for example, 2/14/17) by   
selecting

*Date*

in the

*Numbe*

r formatting box or select a custom format by selecting

*Custom*

in

the

*Number*

box. Excel stores dates in a serial format. January 1, 1900 is day 1, and each sub-

sequent day is numbered sequentially. Both the current date and January 1, 1900 are included   
in the count. So 2/14/17 is 42,780 when expressed in this format. This means there are 42,780   
days between January 1, 1900 and February 14, 2017 (including both days). Therefore, to   
determine the number of days between two dates, you can simply subtract them.

Another useful date function is DATEDIF (which surprisingly doesn't appear in the

*Insert Function*

list!), which can compute the number of whole years, months, or days

between two dates. The syntax of DATEDIF is

DATEDIF(

*startdate, enddate, time unit*

)

The time unit can be "y," "m," or "d." For instance, DATEDIF(4/26/89, 2/14/17, "y") will   
return 27 (years), while DATEDIF(4/26/89, 2/14/17, "m") will return 333 (months).

DAY(date)

These functions simply extract the year, month, and day from a date or cell reference that   
contains a date. The function TODAY( ) displays the current date.

Similar to date functions, times can be formatted in a variety of ways, such as 12:26

PM, Hours:Minutes:Seconds, or in military time. The function NOW( ) displays the cur-  
rent time and date.

[Miscellaneous Excel Functions and Tools](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

In this section, we will illustrate a few miscellaneous Excel functions and tools that sup-  
port analytics applications.

[Range Names](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

A range name is a descriptive label assigned to a cell or range of cells. Range names   
can help to facilitate building models on spreadsheets and understanding the formulas on   
which models are based. There are several ways to create range names in Excel.

EXAMPLE A1.4

Computing Lead Times

In the

Purchase Orders

database, we will compute the lead

time for each order, that is, the number of days between the   
order date and arrival date. [Figure A1.7](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#69)shows the use of

the DATEDIF function. Alternatively, we could have simply   
subtracted the values: for example, in cell K4, use

=

J4

-

I4.

Box to Create a Range Name

Suppose that we create a simple spreadsheet for comput-  
ing total cost (which is the fixed cost plus unit variable cost   
times quantity produced) shown in [Figure A1.8](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#70). We will   
define range names for each of the numerical cells that cor-  
respond to the labels on the left. That is, we will name cell

B3 Fixed cost, cell B4 Unit variable cost, and so on. Click on   
cell B3; in the

Name

box, type the name Fixed_cost (note the

underscore), and then press Enter.[Figure A1.8](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#70)shows that   
the name for cell B3 is displayed in the

Name

box. Repeat

this process for each of the other numerical cells.

Use the

*Name*

box. The name box is at the upper left of a spreadsheet between

the ribbon and the column headers. Usually, it displays the cell reference that is   
selected. To name a range, first select a cell or range and enter the range name   
in the

*Name*

box. Range names cannot contain any spaces, so it is common to

use an underscore between words.

2.

Use

*Create from Selection*

. This option is particularly useful when the names

you want to use are listed in the column immediately to the right or left of   
the cell, or in the row immediately above or below the cell or range. The next   
example illustrates this procedure.

It's not unusual to download data from the Web that looks numerical but is actually   
expressed as text; this is often true of data from U.S. government Web sites. One way   
to tell is that text is usually left justified, while numbers are right justified. The function   
VALUE(

*text*

) can be used to convert a text string that represents a number to a number.

If you cut and paste a cell or a range, Excel will copy any formulas that are contained   
within the cell or range (using the appropriate relative or absolute addressing). In some   
cases, you may only want to paste the numerical values, not the formulas. This can be   
accomplished using the

*Paste Special*

command. From the

*Edit*

group, click the down

arrow on the

*Paste*

icon to display the options and choose

*Paste Special*

.

[Concatenation](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

To concatenate means to join. In many applications, you might wish to take text data that   
are in different columns and join them together (for example, first and last names). The   
Excel function CONCATENATE(

*text1, text2, . . . , text30*

) can be used to join up to 30 text

strings into a single string. For example, suppose that you have a database of names, with   
last names in column A and first names in column B. Suppose that cell A1 contains the last   
name Smith, and cell B1 contains the first name John. Then CONCATENATE(B1, " ", A1)   
will result in the text string John Smith. Note that the cells are separated by a field of open   
quotes around a blank space; this provides a space between the first and last name; other-  
wise, the function would have produced JohnSmith.

We may also perform concatenation using Excel formulas and the operator \&. For

example, to concatenate the text in cells B1 and A1, enter the formula

=

B1\&A1, which

would result in JohnSmith. If we use the formula

=

B1\&" "\&A1, then we are simply

inserting a blank between the names: John Smith. Any text string can be used; for example,

=

"Dr. "\&B1\&" "\&A1 would result in Dr. John Smith.

[Error Values](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#8)

Excel displays various error values if it cannot compute a formula. These error values are   
the following:

■

■

#DIV/0!---A formula is trying to divide by zero.

■

■

#N/A---"Not available," meaning that the formula could not return a result.

■

■

#NAME?---An invalid name is used in a formula.

■

■

#NUM!---An invalid argument is used in a function, such as a negative number in   
SQRT.

■

■

#REF!---A formula contains an invalid cell reference.

■

■

#VALUE!---Excel cannot compute a function because of an invalid argument.

Sometimes these are not user errors, but quirks in the data. For instance, you might have   
missing data in a column that is used in a denominator of a formula and obtain a #DIV/0!   
error. You might use the Excel function IFERROR(

*value*

,

*value_if_error*

) to display a spe-

cific value if an error is present. For example, if you are computing A1/B1, then if B1 is zero   
or blank, the function

=

IFERROR(A1/B1, " ") will display a blank cell instead of #DIV/0!;

or

=

IFERROR(A1/B1, "Check the data in cell B1!") will provide better guidance.

the number of jobs in thousands in the year 2000 and   
projections made for 2010 from a government study.   
Use the Excel file to compute the projected increase   
from the 2000 baseline and the percentage increase   
for each occupational category.

A new graduate has taken a job with an annual sal-  
ary of $60,000. She expects her salary to go up by   
2.5% each year for the first five years. Her starting   
salary is stored in cell A4 of an Excel worksheet, and   
the salary increase rate is stored in cell B4. Construct   
a table with years 1 through 5 in cells A6:A10 and   
her salary in cells B6:B10. Write the formula for her   
salary in year 2 (in cell B7) that can be copied and   
pasted correctly in cells B8 through B10.

Return on investment (ROI) is profit divided by   
investment. In marketing, ROI is determined as   
incremental sales times gross margin minus market-  
ing investment, all divided by marketing investment.   
Suppose that a company plans to spend $3 million to   
place search engine ads and expects $15 million in   
incremental sales. Its gross margin is estimated to be   
45%.

Develop a spreadsheet to compute the marketing   
ROI.

b.

Use the spreadsheet to predict how ROI will   
change if the incremental sales estimate is wrong   
(consider a range of values above and below the   
expected sales).

Chapter 2

Database Analytics

Most organizations begin their analytics journey using descriptive analytics tools

to understand past and current performance to support customer service rep-

resentatives, technical support, manufacturing, and other needs. This typically

involves database analytics---querying databases and "drilling down" to better

understand relationships within data, developing summarized reports, sorting

data, and creating charts to visualize data (discussed in the next chapter)---

techniques most commonly associated with business intelligence/information

systems. These techniques provide a means of translating data into meaning-

ful information. Data are raw numbers and facts, for example, information about

customers, sales, costs, revenue, and so on. When data are manipulated, sum-

marized, or processed in some way to provide insight and understanding, infor-

mation results, which allows managers to make informed decisions.

In your career, you will likely need to extract or manipulate information from a

database. Typical questions that you might address or be asked to determine are

the following:

■

■

How many units did we sell last quarter in each store?

■

■

What was our total cost of materials last month?

■

■

How much profit did we make last month?

■

■

What percentage of customers responded that they are highly likely to recom-

mend us?

■

■

How many defective items did each factory make?

■

■

How many orders were delivered on time?

■

■

How does employee satisfaction differ by job classification and region or factory?

You might also use database analytics in your personal life, for example:

■

■

How did my investment portfolio perform this year as compared to the previ-

ous year?

■

■

In what stocks or mutual funds should I invest?

■

■

Which of my fantasy sports players ranked in the top 10% of performance?

■

■

How did we spend our money last year as compared to our budget?

■

■

How can I compare the cost of living among various cities where I am inter-

viewing for a job?

■

■

What foods should I eat to meet my health goals or nutritional requirements?

The applications are endless! All you need is data, and data are everywhere.

Many sophisticated tools, such as Microsoft Access, SQL (structured query

language), and OLAP (online analytical processing) software, are available to

organize and query data to answer routine business questions, and to process

data to create meaningful information. However, in this book, we won't be delving

deeply into databases or database management systems but will work with indi-

vidual database files or simple data sets. Because spreadsheets are convenient

tools for storing and manipulating data sets and database files, we will use them

for all examples and problems. Thus, in this chapter, we focus only on basic con-

cepts and approaches that can be implemented easily using Excel. We will intro-

duce many useful advanced functions available in Excel and illustrate how they

can be used for descriptive analytics. These functions are also useful in spread-

sheet modeling, which we will study later in this book.

[Data Sets and Databases](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#9)

A

**data set**

is simply a collection of data. Marketing survey responses, a table of historical

stock prices, and a collection of measurements of dimensions of a manufactured item are   
examples of data sets. As we embark on statistical analysis procedures in subsequent chap-  
ters, we will see many examples of

**empirical data**

---data that come from experimentation

and observation.

Most data that managers work with are stored in databases. A

**database**

is a collection

of related files containing records on people, places, or things. Databases provide structure   
to data. The people, places, or things for which we store and maintain information are   
called

*entities*

.

1

A database is usually organized in a two-dimensional table, where the col-

umns correspond to each individual element of data (called

*fields*

, or

*attributes*

), and the

rows represent records of related data elements.

Empirical data, such as those obtained from questionnaires and surveys, are often

organized as databases, and all the database tools that we will learn can be used. The Drout

Chapter 2

Database Analytics

Advertising case at the end of this chapter is one example where you can apply database   
tools to empirical data. Although the databases we will use in this book are "clean," you   
must be aware that many encountered in practice have typos, missing values, or other   
errors, which must be corrected in order to use them effectively.

[Using Range Names in Databases](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#9)

We introduced the concept of range names in spreadsheets in the Appendix to [Chapter 1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30)Using range names for data arrays (that is, rows, columns, or rectangular matrix arrays) can   
greatly simplify many database calculations. The following example shows how to do this.

EXAMPLE 2.2

Defining and Using Range Names for a Database

[Figure 2.2 shows a simple database for monthly sales of](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#79)five products for one year (Excel file

Monthly Product Sales

).

We will define names for each row (months) and column   
(product name) of data. Any of the techniques described in   
[the Appendix to Chapter 1 can be used (we suggest that](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30)you review this material first). For instance, select the range   
B4:B15, which consists of the sales of Product A. In the

Name

box, enter Product_A and press

Enter

. Alternatively,

you can use

Define Name

to do this. Finally, you can select

the entire range of data including the product names and   
use the

Create from Selection

option to define range names

for all products at the same time.

You may use range names to simplify calculations.

For example, to find the total sales, you can use the   
function

=

SUM(Product_A) instead of

=

SUM(B4:B15).

For the

Excel file, use the

*Create from Selection*

option to

define range names for all products (column data) and all months (row data).

3.

For the

*Monthly Product Sales*

Excel file, use the function SUM(B:B) to calculate the

total sales for Product A. What happens if you enter this function in column B?

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Excel also provides a convenient way to include all data in a row or column in a

function. For example, the range for column B is expressed as B:B; the range for row 4 is   
expressed as 4:4, and so on. Therefore,

=

SUM(B:B) will calculate the sum of all data in

[column B; in Figure 2.2, this will be the total sales of Product](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#79)A. The function

SUM(4:4)

will calculate the sum of all data in ro[w 4; in Figure 2.2, this will be the sum of January](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#79)sales for all products. Using these ranges is particularly helpful if you add new data to a   
spreadsheet; you would not have to adjust any defined range names.

Managers make numerous queries about data. For example,[Figure 2.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#80) shows a portion of   
the

*Credit Risk Data*

Excel file, which summarizes loan application data and credit risk

assessment. This database contains the purpose of the loan, the balance of checking and sav-  
ings accounts, how long the applicant has been a customer and length of employment, other   
demographic information, and an assessment of credit risk. A manager might be interested   
in comparing the amount of financial assets as related to the number of months employed,   
finding all loans of a certain type, or the proportion of low credit risk individuals who own   
a home. To address these queries, we need to sort the data in some way. Extracting a set of   
records having certain characteristics is called

*filtering*

the data. Excel provides a convenient

way of formatting databases to facilitate such types of analyses, called

*Tables*

.

An Excel table allows you to use table references to perform basic calculations, as the

next example illustrates.

When the Town of Cary installed wireless meters for 60,000   
customers in 2010, it knew the new technology wouldn't   
just save money by eliminating manual monthly readings;   
the town also realized it would get more accurate and   
timely information about water consumption. The Aquastar   
wireless system reads meters once an hour---that's 8,760   
data points per customer each year instead of 12 monthly   
readings. The data had tremendous potential, if it could be   
easily consumed. The challenge was to analyze half-a-   
billion data points on water usage and make them avail-  
able, visually, to all customers, and gain a big-picture view   
of water consumption to better plan future water plant   
expansions and promote targeted conservation efforts.

Cary used advanced analytics software from SAS

Institute. The ability to visually look at data by household   
or commercial customer, by hour, has led to some very   
practical applications:

The town can notify customers of potential leaks   
within days.

■

■

Customers can set alerts that notify them within hours if   
there is a spike in water usage.

■

■

Customers can track their water usage online, helping   
them to be more proactive in conserving water.

The town estimates that by just removing the need for

manual readings, the Aquastar system will save more than $10   
million after the cost of the project. But the analytics compo-  
nent could provide even bigger savings. Already, both the town   
and individual citizens have saved money by catching water   
leaks early. As the Town of Cary continues to plan its future   
infrastructure needs, having accurate information on water   
usage will help it invest in the right amount of infrastructure at   
the right time. Additionally, understanding water usage will help   
the town if it experiences something detrimental like a drought.

EXAMPLE 2.3

Creating an Excel Table

We will use the

Credit Risk Data

file to illustrate an

Excel

table

. First, select the range of the data, including head-

ers (a useful shortcut is to select the first cell in the upper   
left corner, then click Ctrl+Shift+down arrow, and then   
Ctrl+Shift+right arrow; on a Mac, use the Command key   
instead of Ctrl). Next, click

Table

from the

Tables

group on

the

Insert

tab and make sure that the box for

My Table Has

Headers

is checked. (You may also just select a cell within

the table and then click on

Table

from the

Insert

menu.

Excel will choose the table range for you to verify.) The table   
range will now be formatted and will continue automatically   
[when new data are entered. Figure 2.4 shows a portion of](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#81)

the result. Note that the rows are shaded and that each col-  
umn header has a drop-down arrow to filter the data (we'll   
discuss this shortly). If you click within a table, the

Table

Tools Design

tab will appear in the ribbon, allowing you to

do a variety of things, such as change the color scheme,   
remove duplicates, and change the formatting.

A useful option in the

Design

tab is to add a total row.

In the

Table Style Options

group, check the box for

Total

Row

, and Excel will add a new row at the bottom of the

table. If you click on any cell in the total row, you can select   
the type of calculation you want from the drop-down box;   
this includes SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, and MIN.

EXAMPLE 2.4

Table-Based Calculations

Suppose that in the

Credit Risk Data

table, we wish

to calculate the total amount of savings in col-  
umn C. We could, of course, simply use the function   
=SUM(C4:C428). However, with a table, we could use the   
formula

=

SUM(Table1\[Savings\])

.

The table name, Table1,

can be found (and changed) in the

Properties

group of the

Table Tools Design

tab in Windows or in the

Table

tab on a

Mac. Note that Savings is the name of the header in column   
C. One of the advantages of doing this is that if we add   
new records to the table, the calculation will be updated   
automatically, and we don't have to change the range in   
the formula or get a wrong result if we forget to. As another   
example, we could find the number of home owners using   
the function

=

COUNTIF(Table1\[Housing\],

"

Own

"

).

If you add additional records at the end of the table, they will automatically be included

and formatted, and if you create a chart based on the data, the chart will automatically be   
updated if you add new records.

Excel provides many ways to sort lists by rows or column or in ascending or descending   
order and using custom sorting schemes. The sort buttons in Excel can be found under the

*Data*

tab (see [Figure 2.5;](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#82) the Mac

tab ribbon is similar). Select a single cell in the

column you want to sort on and click the "AZ down arrow" button to sort from smallest to   
largest or the "AZ up arrow" button to sort from largest to smallest. You may also click the

*Sort*

button to specify criteria for more advanced sorting capabilities.

particular supplier.

EXAMPLE 2.6

Applying the Pareto Principle

The Excel file

Bicycle Inventory

lists the inventory of bicycle

models in a sporting goods store.

4

To conduct a Pareto

analysis, we first compute the inventory value of each prod-  
uct by multiplying the quantity on hand by the purchase   
cost; this is the amount invested in the items that are cur-  
rently in stock. Then we sort the data in decreasing order of   
inventory value and compute the percentage of the total

inventory value for each product and the cumulative per-  
centage. See [columns G through I in Figure 2.7. We see](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#83)that about 75% of the inventory value is accounted for by   
less than 40% (9 of 24) of the items. If these high-value   
inventories aren't selling well, the store manager may wish   
to keep fewer in stock.

**Pareto analysis**

is a term named after an Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto, who, in 1906,

observed that a large proportion of the wealth in Italy was owned by a relatively small pro-  
portion of the people. The Pareto principle is often seen in many business situations. For   
example, a large percentage of sales usually comes from a small percentage of customers,   
a large percentage of quality defects stems from just a couple of sources, or a large percent-  
age of inventory value corresponds to a small percentage of items. As a result, the Pareto   
principle is also often called the "80--20 rule," referring to the generic situation in which   
80% of some output comes from 20% of some input. A Pareto analysis relies on sorting   
data and calculating the cumulative percentage of the characteristic of interest.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive083.png)

For large data files, finding a particular subset of records that meet certain characteristics   
by sorting can be tedious.

**Filtering**

simplifies this process. Excel provides two filtering

tools:

*AutoFilter*

for simple criteria and

*Advanced Filter*

for more complex criteria. These

tools are best understood by working through some examples.

Then, from the Excel

. A drop-down

arrow will then be displayed on the right side of each

Database Analytics

*Caution!*

The

*Filter*

tool does not

*extract*

the records; it simply

*hides*

the records

that don't match the criteria. This means that if you highlight a range of filtered data to   
compute a sum or average, for example, you will get the results for

*all*

records, including

those that are hidden from view. However, you can copy and paste the filtered data to   
another range or Excel worksheet, which then uses only the filtered records, and get the   
correct results.

The

*Advanced Filter*

provides a way of explicitly defining criteria by which to fil-

ter a database. To do this, first copy the headers from the database to an open location   
in the worksheet. Under the headers, specify the criteria that you want to use to filter   
the data. Multiple criteria in the same row are logically joined by "and," while cri-  
teria in rows are joined by "or." In general, criteria for numerical values can include

=

,

7

,

6

,

6 7

(not equal),

7

=

, or

6

=

.

EXAMPLE 2.9

Using the

Advanced Filter

We will use the

Purchase Orders

database. [Figure 2.12](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#85)

shows the criteria by which we want to filter the records.   
These criteria will find all the records for Hulkey Fasteners   
having order quantities that exceed 5,000 and order dates   
before 9/1/11, as well as all records for Steelpin Inc. with   
order quantities less than 5,000 and order dates before   
9/1/11. You need not include columns that have no crite-  
ria; in this case, we could have simply listed the columns

Supplier, Quantity, and Order Date along with the speci-  
fied criteria.

To use the

Advanced Filter

, choose

Advanced

next

to the

Filter

in the

Data

list range of the database and the criteria range (see   
[Figure 2.13). Figure 2.14 shows the results; note that only](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#86)the records meeting the criteria are displayed.

name that corresponds to the criteria range A3:J5, in the

Using the DSUM Function

Allders International specializes in duty-free operations   
with 82 tax-free retail outlets throughout Europe, includ-  
ing shops in airports and seaports and on cross-channel   
ferries. Like most retail outlets, Allders International must   
track masses of point-of-sale data to assist in inventory   
and product-mix decisions. Which items to stock at   
each of its outlets can have a significant impact on the   
firm's profitability. To assist them, they implemented a   
computer-based data warehouse to maintain the data.   
Prior to doing this, they had to analyze large quanti-  
ties of paper-based data. This manual process was so   
overwhelming and time-consuming that the analyses   
were often too late to provide useful information for their   
decisions. The data warehouse allowed the company to   
make simple queries, such as finding the performance   
of a particular item across all retail outlets or the finan-  
cial performance of a particular outlet, quickly and eas-  
ily. This allowed them to identify which inventory items   
or outlets were underperforming. For instance, a Pareto   
analysis of its product lines (groups of similar items)

ANALYTICS IN PRACTICE:

found that about 20% of the product lines were generating   
80% of the profits. This allowed them to selectively elimi-  
nate some of the items from the other 80% of the product   
lines, which freed up shelf space for more profitable items   
and reduced inventory and supplier costs.

**Logical functions**

depend on whether one or more conditions are true or false. A

*condition*

is a statement about the value of a cell, either numeric or text. Three useful logical func-  
tions in business analytics applications are the following:

IF(

*condition, value if true, value if false*

)---a logical function that returns one value if

the condition is true and another if the condition is false

AND(

*condition 1, condition 2*

, . . . )---a logical function that returns TRUE if all

conditions are true and FALSE if not

OR(

*condition 1, condition 2*

, . . . )---a logical function that returns TRUE if any con-

dition is true and FALSE if not

The IF function, IF(

*condition, value if true, value if false*

), allows you to choose one

of two values to enter into a cell. If the specified

*condition*

is true,

*value if true*

will be put

in the cell. If the condition is false,

*value if false*

will be entered.

*Value if true*

and

*value if*

*false*

can be a number or a text string enclosed in quotes. For example, if cell C2 contains

the function

=

IF(A8

=

2,7,12), it states that if the value in cell A8 is 2, the number 7 will

be assigned to cell C2; if the value in cell A8 is not 2, the number 12 will be assigned to   
cell C2. Conditions may include the following:

=

equal to

7

greater than

6

less than

7

=

greater than or equal to

6

=

less than or equal to

6 7

not equal to

Note that if a blank is used between quotes, " ", then the result will simply be a blank cell.   
This is often useful to create a clean spreadsheet.

AND and OR functions simply return the values of

*true*

or

*false*

if all or at least

one of multiple conditions are met, respectively. You may use AND and OR functions   
as the

*condition*

within an IF function; for example,

=

IF(AND(B1

=

3,C1

=

5),12,22).

Here, if cell B1

=

3 and cell C1

=

5, then the value of the function is 12; otherwise,

it is 22.

EXAMPLE 2.11

Using the IF Function

In the

Purchase Orders

database, suppose that the aircraft

component manufacturer considers any order of 10,000   
units or more to be large, whereas any other order size is   
considered to be small. We may use the IF function to clas-  
sify the orders. First, create a new column in the spreadsheet   
for the order size, say, column K. In cell K4, use the formula

=

IF(F4

7

=

10000,

"

Large

"

,

"

Small

"

)

This function will return the value

Large

in cell K4 if the

order size in cell F4 is 10,000 or more; otherwise, it returns

the value

Small

. Further, suppose that large orders with a

total cost of at least $25,000 are considered critical. We   
may flag these orders as critical by using the function in   
cell L4:

=

IF(AND(K4

=

"

Large

"

, G4

7

=

25000),

"

Critical

"

,

"

"

)

Note that we use open quotes to return a blank cell if the   
order is not critical. After copying these formulas down the   
[columns, Figure 2.16 shows a portion of the results.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#89)

60

Chapter 2

Database Analytics

You may "nest" up to seven IF functions by replacing

*value if true*

or

*value if false*

in

an IF function with another IF function:

=

IF(A8

=

2,(IF(B3

=

5, "YES", "")),15)

This says that if cell A8 equals 2, then check the contents of cell B3. If cell B3 is 5, then   
the value of the function is the text string YES; if not, it is a blank space. However, if cell   
A8 is not 2, then the value of the function is 15 no matter what cell B3 is. One tip to do this   
easily is to write out each IF formula first, then successively embed them into one formula.

EXAMPLE 2.12

Calculating the Price of Quantity Discounts

Suppose that a company offers quantity discounts on   
purchases. For quantities of 1,000 or less, the unit price is   
$10; for quantities of 1,001 to 5,000, the unit price is $9.00;   
and for quantities that exceed 5,000, the unit price is $7.50.   
We may use nested IF functions to compute the total cost   
for any purchase quantity. Here is the logic. Let Q represent   
the purchase quantity. If Q

6

=

1,000, the price is

$

10

\*

Q;

if this is not true, then we need to check if Q

6

=

5,000.

If so, the price will be

$

9.00

\*

Q. Finally, if this is false,

then the quantity must exceed 5,000, and the price will be

$

7.50

\*

Q. Write the first IF statement as

IF

1

Q

6

=

1,000, Q

\*

10,

value

if

false

2

If this is false, we would have the following IF statement:

IF

1

Q

6

=

5,000, Q

\*

9,

value

if

false

2

If this is false, the value must be Q times 7.5.

Now substitute:

false

)

EXAMPLE 2.13

Using the VLOOKUP Function

A database of sales transactions for a firm that sells instruc-  
tional fitness books and DVDs is provided in the Excel file

Sales Transactions

. The database is sorted by customer ID,

and a portion of it is shown in[Figure 2.18.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#91) Suppose that   
a customer calls a representative about a payment issue.   
The representative finds the customer ID---for example,   
10007---and needs to look up the type of payment and   
transaction code. We may use the VLOOKUP function to do   
this. In the function

=

VLOOKUP(

lookup_value, table_array,

col_index_num

),

lookup_value

represents the customer

ID. The

table_array

is the range of the data in the spread-

sheet; in this case, it is the range A4:H475. The value for

col_index_num

represents the column in the table range we

wish to retrieve. For the type of payment, this is column 3;   
for the transaction code, this is column 4. Note that the first   
column is already sorted in ascending numerical order, so   
we can either omit the

range lookup

argument or set it as

True

. Thus, if we enter the formula below in any blank cell of

the spreadsheet (we recommend using absolute references   
for arrays)

=

VLOOKUP(10007,

$

A

$

4:

$

H

$

475,3)

it returns the payment type

Credit

. If we use the following

formula:

=

VLOOKUP(10007,

$

A

$

4:

$

H

$

475,4)

the function returns the transaction code 80103311.

Now suppose the database was sorted by

transaction code so that the customer ID column is   
no longer in ascending numerical order, as shown   
[in Figure 2.19.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#91) If we use the function

=

VLOOKUP

(10007,

$

A

$

4:

$

H

$

475,4, True), Excel returns #N/A.

However, if we change the

range lookup

argument to

False, then the function returns the correct value of the   
transaction code.

Excel provides some useful

**lookup functions**

for finding specific data in a spreadsheet.

These are the following:

VLOOKUP(

*lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, \[range lookup\]*

) looks up a

value in the leftmost column of a table (specified by the

*table_array*

) and returns

a value in the same row from a column you specify (

*col_index_num*

).

HLOOKUP(

*lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, \[range lookup\]*

) looks up a

value in the top row of a table and returns a value in the same column from a row   
you specify.

INDEX(

*array, row_num, col_num*

) returns a value or reference of the cell at the

intersection of a particular row and column in a given range.

MATCH(

*lookup_value, lookup_array, match_type*

) returns the relative position of an

item in an array that matches a specified value in a specified order.

CHOOSE(

*index_num, value1, value2, . . .*

) returns a value from a list based on the

position in the list, specified by

*index_num*

.

In the VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP functions,

*range lookup*

is optional. If this is omit-

ted or set as

*True*

, then the first column of the table must be sorted in ascending numerical

order. If an exact match for the

*lookup_value*

is found in the first column, then Excel will

return the value of the

*col_index_num*

of that row. If an exact match is not found, Excel

will choose the row with the largest value in the first column that is less than the

*lookup_*

*value*

. If

*range lookup*

is

*False*

, then Excel seeks an exact match in the first column of the

table range. If no exact match is found, Excel will return #N/A (not available). We recom-  
mend that you specify the range lookup to avoid errors.

The HLOOKUP function works in a similar fashion. For most spreadsheet databases,

we would normally need to use the VLOOKUP function. In some modeling situations,   
however, the HLOOKUP function can be useful if the data are arranged column by column   
rather than row by row.

The INDEX function works as a lookup procedure by returning the value in a par-

ticular row and column of an array. For example, in the

*Sales Transactions*

database,

=

INDEX($A$4:$H$475, 7, 4) would retrieve the transaction code 80103311 that is in

the 7th ro[w and 4th column of the data array (see Figure 2.18), as the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#91)VLOOKUP func-

actual value of the customer ID.

In the MATCH function,

*lookup_value*

is the value that you want to match in

*lookup_*

*array*

, which is the range of cells being searched. The

*match_type*

is either

1, 0, or 1. The

default is 1. If

*match*

*type*

=

1, then the function finds the largest value that is less than or

equal to

*lookup_value*

; however, the values in the

*lookup_array*

must be placed in ascend-

ing order. If

*match*

*type*

=

0, MATCH finds the first value that is exactly equal to

*lookup_*

*value*

; in this case the values in the

*lookup_array*

can be in any order. If

*match*

*type*

=

-

1,

then the function finds the smallest value that is greater than or equal to

*lookup_value*

; in

this case the values in the

*lookup_array*

must be placed in descending order[. Example 2.14](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#92)

shows how the INDEX and MATCH functions can be used.

The VLOOKUP function will not work if you want to look up something to the left of a

specified range (because it uses the first column of the range to find the lookup value). How-  
ever, we can use the INDEX and MATCH functions easily to do this, as[Example 2.14](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#92)shows.

Monthly Product

Sales Queries

. Suppose we wish to design a simple query

application to input the month and product name, and   
retrieve the corresponding sales. The three additional work-  
sheets in the workbook show how to do this in three dif-  
ferent ways. The

Query1

[worksheet (see Figure 2.21) uses](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#92)

the VLOOKUP function with embedded IF statements. The   
formula in cell I8 is

=

VLOOKUP(I5, A4:F15, IF(I6

=

"

A

"

, 2, IF(I6

=

"

B

"

, 3,

IF(I6

=

"

C

"

,4, IF(I6

=

"

D

"

, 5, IF(I6

=

"

E

"

, 6))))),FALSE)

The IF functions are used to determine the column in the   
lookup table to use and, as you can see, is somewhat com-  
plex, especially if the table were much larger.

The

Query2

worksheet (not shown here; see the

Excel workbook) uses the VLOOKUP and MATCH func-  
tions in cell I8. The formula in cell I8 is

=

VLOOKUP(I5,A4:F15,MATCH(I6,B3:F3,0)

+

1,FALSE)

In this case, the MATCH function is used to identify the   
column in the table corresponding to the product name in   
cell I6. Note the use of the

"

+

1

"

to shift the relative column

number of the product to the correct column number in the   
lookup table.

Finally, the

Query3

worksheet (also not shown here)

uses only INDEX and MATCH functions in cell I8. The for-  
mula in cell I8 is

=

INDEX(A4:F15,MATCH(I5,A4:A15,0),MATCH(I6,A3:F3,0))

The MATCH functions are used as arguments in the INDEX   
function to identify the row and column numbers in the table   
based on the month and product name. The INDEX func-  
tion then retrieves the value in the corresponding row and   
column. This is perhaps the cleanest formula of the three.   
By studying these examples carefully, you will better under-  
stand how to use these functions in other applications.

Many database queries are repetitive; think of customer service representatives who must   
look up order information, prices, and so on. We may use the logical and lookup functions   
that we studied in the previous section to create user-friendly

**Excel templates**

for repeti-

tive database queries. W[e did this in Example 2.14 for f](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#92)inding sales for a specific month   
and product name. In this section, we discuss some design approaches and Excel tools.

An Excel template would typically have input cells, result cells, and possibly interme-

diate calculations. Templates should be "clean," well organized, and easy to use. Validation   
tools should be used to ensure that users do not inadvertently make errors in input data.   
Visualizations, such as charts, which will be discussed in the next chapter, can be included   
for additional insight.

3.

Write an Excel function that is entered in cell J2 that will find the amount of an order   
for any customer ID in the

database using (1) only VLOOKUP, and

(2) only the INDEX and MATCH functions.

EXAMPLE 2.15

Using INDEX and MATCH for a Left Table Lookup

Suppose that, in the

Sales Transactions

database, we wish

to find the customer ID associated with a specific transac-  
[tion code. Refer back to Figure 2.18 or the Excel workbook.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#91)Suppose that we enter the transaction code in cell K2 and   
want to display the customer ID in cell K4. Use the following   
formula in cell K4:

=

INDEX(A4:A475,MATCH(K2,D4:D475,0),1)

Here, the MATCH function is used to identify the row num-  
ber in the table range that matches the transaction code   
exactly, and the INDEX function uses this row number and   
column 1 to identify the associated customer ID.

To illustrate the CHOOSE function, suppose that in the monthly product sales

data (see [Figure 2.20)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#79), we want to select the January sales of product B. We could   
use

=

CHOOSE(2,B4,C4,D4,E4,F4), which would return the value 5,554. We may also

specify a list of text names, such as

=

CHOOSE(2,"A","B","C","D","E"), which would

return B.

Excel Template for Identifying Tax Bracket

to select the proper lookup range based on the filing   
status code.

An alternative way of doing this would be to use the

CHOOSE function as follows ("Lookup" is the name of the   
worksheet containing the lookup table):

=CHOOSE(

$B$9

,VLOOKUP(

$B$10

,Lookup!$A$2:$E$8,5),

VLOOKUP(

$B$10

,Lookup!$B$2:$E$8,4),VLOOKUP(

$B$10

,

Lookup!$C$2:$E$8,3),VLOOKUP(

$B$10

,Lookup!$D$2:$E$8,2))

We will create a simple template (see the Excel

file

Tax Bracket Template

) that allows an individual to

enter their filing status and taxable income and then   
returns the corresponding tax bracket. This is shown in   
[Figure 2.22](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#94). We can use a lookup table to identify the   
tax rate. First, note that the main worksheet does not   
include the lookup table to keep the template clean.   
The input and results cells are color-coded to separate   
inputs from the result. We used a nested IF statement

Excel provides various

**data validation**

tools to reduce the chances that users will make

a mistake. First, select the cell range for which data validation will be applied, and then   
choose

Chapter 2

Database Analytics

Another way of applying data validation for numerical inputs is to use the ISNUMBER   
function. This function returns TRUE if the cell or range contains a number; otherwise, it   
returns FALSE. This can help to avoid any typing mistakes resulting from inadvertently   
pressing a letter or symbol key.

Database Analytics

To insert a form control, click the

*Insert*

button in the

*Controls*

tab under the

*Developer*

menu, click on the control you want to use, and then click within your worksheet. The follow-  
ing example shows how to use both a spin button and scroll bar in the Tax Bracket template.

EXAMPLE 2.19

Using Form Controls in the Tax Bracket Template

In the Tax Bracket template, we will use a spin button for   
the filing status and a scroll bar for the taxable income (in   
unit increments of $100, from $0 through $500,000). The   
[completed spreadsheet is shown in Figure 2.27.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#97)

First, click the

Insert

button in the

Controls

group of the

Developer

tab, select the spin button, click it, and then click

somewhere in the worksheet. The spin button (and any form   
control) can be re-sized by dragging the handles along the   
edge and moving the button within the worksheet. Move it to   
a convenient location, and enter the name you wish to use   
(such as Filing Status) adjacent to it. Next, right click the spin   
button and select

Format Control

. You will see the dialog box

shown in[Figure 2.28.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#98) Enter the values shown and click

OK

.

Now if you click the up or down buttons, the value in cell B9   
will change within the specified range.

Next, repeat this process by inserting the scroll bar

next to the taxable income cell. Right click the scroll bar   
and select

Format Control

. For a scroll bar, the maxi-

mum value is limited to 30,000, so we need to scale the   
parameters so that the taxable income can vary up to   
$500,000. Set the parameters in the dialog for a minimum   
value of 0 and maximum value of 5,000, with an incre-  
mental change of 1. Choose a blank cell for the cell link   
(say, D9). Then, in cell B10, enter the formula

=

D9

\*

100.

Now when the scroll bar is moved, the income will   
change from 0 to $500,000. You may also click the   
arrows on the end of the scroll bar to fine-tune the value.   
Using these controls, you can easily change the inputs in   
the template.

▶

▶

Figure 2.27

Tax Bracket Template with Form Controls

Form controls only allow integer increments, so you would also have to scale values

to change a number by a fractional value. For example, suppose that we want to use a spin   
button to change an interest rate that is in cell B8 from 0% to 10% in increments of 0.1%   
(that is, 0.001). Choose some empty cell, say, C8, and enter a value between 0 and 100 in   
it. Then enter the formula

=

C8/1000 in cell B8. Note that if the value in C8

=

40, for

example, then the value in cell B8 will be 40/1000

=

0.04, or 4%. Then as the value in cell

C8 changes by 1, the value in cell B8 changes by 1/1,000, or 0.1%. In the

*Format Control*

dialog, specify the minimum value at 0 and the maximum value at 100 and link the button   
to cell C8. Now as you click the up or down arrows on the spin button, the value in cell C8   
changes by 1 and the value in cell B8 changes by 0.1%.

Other form controls can also be used; for instance, in the Tax Bracket template, you

pute the total sales for any month in the

Monthly Product

Sales

database. We set the cell link to H1; this provides

the row number of the month in the data array to use in   
an INDEX function to compute total sales. The formula in   
cell H7 is

=

SUM(INDEX(B4:F15,H1,0)). Using a 0 as the

column number references the entire row, so the func-  
tion sums all the columns in the row listed in cell H1. In   
the Format Control dialog, set the Drop Down lines to 12;   
this will display all 12 months when the arrow button is   
clicked. A smaller number will require you to scroll down   
to seem them all.

Excel provides a powerful tool for distilling a complex database into meaningful informa-  
tion:

**PivotTables**

(yes, it is one word!). PivotTables allows you to create custom summa-

ries and charts of key information in the data and to drill down into a large set of data in   
numerous ways. In this section, we will introduce PivotTables in the context of databases;   
however, we will also use them in other chapters to facilitate data visualization and statisti-  
cal analysis of data sets.

To apply PivotTables, first, select any cell in the database and choose

*PivotTable*

under the

*Insert*

tab and follow the steps of the wizard. We will use the

*Sales Transactions*

database (see [Figure 2.18](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#91)). Excel first asks you to select a table or range of data; if you   
click on any cell within the database before inserting a PivotTable, Excel will default to the   
complete range of your data. You may either put the PivotTable into a new worksheet or in   
a blank range of the existing worksheet. Excel then creates a blank PivotTable, as shown   
[in Figure 2.30.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#100)

that correspond to the headers in the database. You select which ones you want to include,   
as row labels, column labels, values, or a

*filter*

. You should first decide what types of tables

you wish to create---that is, what fields you want for the rows, columns, and data values.

[ure 2.31. The values in column B are the sum of the sales](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#100)revenues for each region. You may select the range of the   
value, right click, and format the cells as currency to make   
the PivotTable more meaningful. You may also replace the   
names in the headers; for instance, change Row Labels to   
Region and Sum of Amount to Revenue. The drop-down   
arrow next to Row Labels allows you to filter the results   
and display only selected regions. These modifications are   
[shown in Figure 2.32.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#100)

The beauty of PivotTables is that if you wish to

change the analysis, you can simply drag the field

names out of the field areas (or just uncheck the boxes   
in the PivotTable

Field

list) or drag them to differ-

ent areas. For example, if you drag the

Product

field

into the

Columns

area, you will create the PivotTable

in [Figure 2.33,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#101) showing the breakdown of revenues   
by product for each region. Another option is to drag

Product

to the

Rows

area, as shown in [Figure 2.34.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#101)

The order in which the fields are listed will also change   
the view (try moving

Region

after

Product

). The best

way to learn about PivotTables is simply to experiment   
with them.

Dragging a field into the

Filters

area in the PivotTable

Field

list allows you to add a third dimension to your

analysis. For example, moving

Payment

to the

Filters

area

allows you to filter revenues by PayPal or credit, as shown   
[in Figure 2.35.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#102)

When you drag a field into the

This results in the PivotTable shown in [Figure 2.37](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#103)(after reformatting the values   
to numbers instead of currency). Now we can see how many books and DVDs were sold   
in each region.

Excel has a tool called

**slicers**

---for drilling down to "slice" a PivotTable and display a

subset of data. Slicers simplify the process of filtering a PivotTable and are very useful in   
presentations to quickly show alternate PivotTable views. To create a slicer for any of the   
columns in the database, click on the PivotTable and choose

*Insert Slicer*

from the

*Analyze*

tab in the

*PivotTable Tools*

ribbon in Windows, or from the

*PivotTable Analyze*

tab on a

The Excel file

*President's Inn Guest Database*

pro-

vides a list of customers, rooms they occupied, arrival   
and departure dates, number of occupants, and daily   
rate for a small bed-and-breakfast inn during one   
month.

Room rates include breakfast and are the same

for one or two guests; however, any additional guests   
must pay an extra $20 per person per day for breakfast.   
Parties staying for seven days or more receive a 10%   
discount on the room rate as well as any additional   
breakfast fees. Modify the spreadsheet to calculate the   
number of days that each party stayed at the inn and   
the total revenue for the length of stay.

A manager has a list of items that have been sorted   
according to an item ID. Some of them are duplicates.

She wants to add a code to the database that assigns a   
1 to the item if it is unique, and if there are duplicates,   
assigns the number of the duplicate. An example is   
shown below. The first two items are unique, so the   
repeat code is 1. However, item ID 37692 is listed six   
times, so the codes are assigned from 1 to 6, and so   
on. Explain how to assign the correct code using an   
IF statement.

Database Analytics

Lookup Functions for Database Queries

24.

A manager needs to identify some information from   
the

*Purchase Orders*

database but has only the order

number. Modify the Excel file to use the VLOOKUP   
function to find the item description and cost per   
order for the following order numbers: Aug11008,   
Sep11023, and Oct11020.

25.

The Excel file

*S\&P 500*

provides open, high, low,

and close values for the S\&P 500 index over a period   
of time.

a.

Enter any date (using the format month/day/year)   
within the range of the data in cell G2. Use a   
MATCH function in cell G3 to find the row in the   
database that corresponds to this date.

b.

Write an INDEX function in cell G4 that finds   
the closing value on this date using your answer   
to part a.

c.

Combine the MATCH and INDEX functions in   
parts a and b into one function that displays the   
closing value in cell G5.

26.

Enhance the

*Sales Transactions*

database file to per-

form a database query that finds the transaction code   
and amount associated with any customer ID input.   
Apply your results to customer ID 10029.

27.

Enhance the

*Treasury Yield Rates*

database file to

perform a database query that finds the rate associ-  
ated with any date and term. (This is a challenging   
question because you will not be able to use the term   
headers in a MATCH function. Hint: Add a row that   
assigns a code from 1 to 11 for each term. Then use   
the code for your input value. You might also use a   
lookup function to convert the code back to the actual   
term as part of the output.)

28.

For this exercise, use the

*Purchase Orders*

database.

Use MATCH and/or INDEX functions to find the   
following:

a.

The row numbers corresponding to the first and   
last instance of item number 1369 in column C   
(be sure column C is sorted by item number).

b.

The order cost associated with the first instance   
of item 1369 that you identified in part a.

c.

The total cost of all orders for item 1369. Use the   
answers to parts a. and b. along with the SUM   
function to do this. In other words, you should   
use the appropriate INDEX and MATCH func-  
tions within the SUM function to find the answer.   
Validate your results by applying the SUM func-  
tion directly to the data in column G.

29.

Use INDEX and MATCH functions to fill in a table   
that extracts the amounts shipped between each pair   
of cities in the Excel file

*General Appliance Cor-*

*poration*

, which shows the solution to an optimiza-

tion model that finds the minimum cost and amounts   
shipped from two plants to four distribution centers.   
Your table should be set up as follows, and the for-  
mulas for the Amount Shipped column should refer-  
ence the names in the From and To columns:

From

To

Amount Shipped

Marietta

Cleveland

Marietta

Baltimore

Marietta

Chicago

Marietta

Phoenix

Minneapolis

Cleveland

30.

In the

*Purchase Orders*

database, we need to find

the order number and the supplier that made a pur-  
chase totaling $9,045. Write functions for a left table   
lookup to answer these queries.

31.

An auditor found an expense receipt for $179.24   
without a name. Write a left table lookup func-  
tion that would identify the sales rep in the

*Travel*

*Expenses*

database.

32.

Use the CHOOSE function to develop a database   
query for the

*Monthly Product Sales*

data that will

complete the following table for any month specified   
in the top left corner:

Month

Product

A

Product

B

Product

C

Product

D

Product

E

Sales

Each empty cell should contain only one CHOOSE

function. Hint: Use other appropriate functions to deter-  
mine the row associated with the specified month.

Excel Template Design

33.

Suppose that a company offers quantity discounts.   
If up to 1,000 units are purchased, the unit price is   
$10; if more than 1,000 and up to 5,000 units are pur-  
chased, the unit price is $9; and if more than 5,000   
units are purchased, the unit price is $7.50. Develop   
an Excel template using the VLOOKUP function to   
find the unit price associated with any order quantity   
and compute the total cost of the order.

A college graduate who is living in Cincinnati expects   
to earn an annual salary of $55,000. The Excel file

*Cost*

*of Living Adjustments*

shows the comparative salaries

in other cities and percentage adjustments for living   
expenses. Develop an Excel template that allows the   
user to enter current annual expenses (in Cincinnati)   
for groceries, housing, utilities, transportation, and   
health care and compute the corresponding expenses   
for any selected city and the net salary surplus for both   
Cincinnati and the selected city. An example of what   
the output should look like is provided next:

The Excel file

*Payroll Data*

provides hourly salaries

for a group of employees. Create an Excel template   
that allows the user to select an employee by employee   
ID, enter the number of regular hours and overtime   
hours worked, and display a payroll summary with the   
employee name, gross pay, federal tax, state tax, Social   
Security, Medicare withholding deductions, and net   
pay. Assume that the federal tax rate is 11%, the state   
tax rate is 2.385%, Social Security withholding is 6.2%,   
and Medicare withholding is 1.45%. Use a form control   
to select the employee ID. (Hint: Use the CONCAT-  
ENATE function to join the first and last name in your   
template.

The author expresses appreciation to Jamie Drout for providing this original material from her class

project as the basis for this case.

Jamie Drout is interested in perceptions of gender stereotypes   
within beauty product advertising, which includes soap,   
deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, perfume, cologne,   
makeup, chemical hair color, razors, skin care, feminine care,   
and salon services, as well as the perceived benefits of empow-  
erment advertising. Gender stereotypes specifically use cul-  
tural perceptions of what constitutes an attractive, acceptable,   
and desirable man or woman, frequently exploiting specific   
gender roles, and are commonly employed in advertisements   
for beauty products. Women are represented as delicately   
feminine, strikingly beautiful, and physically flawless, occu-  
pying small amounts of physical space that generally exploit   
their sexuality; men are represented as strong and masculine,   
with chiseled physical bodies, occupying large amounts of   
physical space to maintain their masculinity and power. In   
contrast, empowerment advertising strategies negate gender   
stereotypes and visually communicate the unique differences   
in each individual. In empowerment advertising, men and   
women are to represent the diversity in beauty, body type,   
and levels of perceived femininity and masculinity. Jamie's   
project is focused on understanding consumer perceptions of   
these advertising strategies.

Jamie conducted a survey using the following

Chapter 3

Data Visualization

Making sense of large quantities of disparate data is necessary not only for gaining

competitive advantage in today's business environment, but also for surviving in

it. Converting data into information to understand past and current performance

is the core of descriptive analytics and is vital to making good business deci-

sions. The old adage "A picture is worth 1,000 words" is probably truer in today's

information--rich environment than ever before.

Data visualization

is the process

of displaying data (often in large quantities) in a meaningful fashion to provide

insights that will support better decisions. Researchers have observed that data

visualization improves decision making, provides managers with better analysis

capabilities that reduce reliance on IT professionals, and improves collaboration

and information sharing. In your career, you will most likely use data visualization

extensively as an analysis tool and to communicate data and information to oth-

ers. For example, if you work in finance, you can use data visualization to track

revenues, costs, and profits over time; to compare performance between years

or among different departments; and to track budget performance. In marketing,

you can use data visualization to show trends in customer satisfaction, compare

sales among different regions, and show the impact of advertising strategies. In

operations, you might illustrate the performance of different facilities, product

quality, call volumes in a technical support department, or supply chain metrics

such as late deliveries.

In this chapter, we will illustrate how to construct and use Excel charts and

other Excel visualization tools and how to build dashboards that summarize and

communicate key information visually.

[The Value of Data Visualization](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#9)

Raw data are important, particularly when one needs to identify accurate values or com-  
pare individual numbers. However, it is quite difficult to identify trends and patterns, find   
exceptions, or compare groups of data in tabular form. The human brain does a surpris-  
ingly good job of processing visual information---if presented in an effective way. Visual-  
izing data provides a way of communicating data at all levels of a business and can reveal   
surprising patterns and relationships, thereby providing important insights for making   
decisions. It also helps users to more quickly understand and interpret data, and helps   
analysts choose the most appropriate data analysis tool. For many unique and intriguing   
examples of data visualization, visit the Data Visualization Gallery at the U.S. Census   
Bureau W[eb site, www.census.gov/dataviz/.](http://www.census.gov/dataviz/)

In addition to descriptive analytics, data visualization is important for predictive and

prescriptive analytics as well. For example, recall the chart predicting new product sales   
over time, shown in [Figure 1.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#47)in[Chapter 1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30).

easily than would either a verbal description or mathematical model. Visualizing a pat-  
tern also helps analysts select the most appropriate mathematical function to model the   
phenomenon. Complex prescriptive models often yield complex results. Visualizing the   
results often helps in understanding and gaining insight about model output and solutions.

. We can use the data to determine exactly how many

units of a certain product were sold in a particular month, or   
to compare one month to another. For example, we see that   
sales of product A dropped in February, specifically by 6.7%   
(computed by the Excel formula

such calculations, however, it is difficult to draw big--picture

conclusions.[Figure 3.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#116) displays a chart of monthly sales   
for each product. We can easily compare overall sales of   
different products (product C sells the least, for example)   
and identify trends (sales of product D are increasing), other   
patterns (sales of product C are relatively stable, while sales   
of product B fluctuate more over time), and exceptions   
( product E's sales fell considerably are September).

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

The New York City Police Department (NYPD), the largest   
state or local police force in the United States, is charged   
with securing New York City from crime and terrorism. The   
department had accumulated a tremendous amount of   
information but had limited means of sharing it among its   
officers. Much of the information was available only to offi-  
cers in the precinct house with permission to access stand-  
alone software applications, with little analytics or data   
visualization techniques to give the officers any insight.

In 2008, the NYPD began developing a new system,

the Domain Awareness System (DAS), which is a citywide   
network of sensors, databases, devices, software, and   
infrastructure that informs decision making by delivering   
analytics and tailored information to officers' smartphones   
and precinct desktops. The NYPD has used the system to   
employ a unique combination of analytics and information   
technology.

INFORMS.

A key feature of the system is data visualization. Prior to

the DAS, reports simply listed data in numerical tables. The   
only analysis presented might be a year-to-year percentage   
change. Using it to pick out geographic clusters or potential   
patterns was virtually impossible. Today, information is pre-  
sented in an interactive form. If a user clicks on a number, DAS   
brings up all the records included in that number and marks   
them on the map. The NYPD also constructed a data visualiza-  
tion engine to enable the user to explore trends and patterns   
in the statistics. Bar and pie charts of categorical data and line   
charts of temporal data are available with the press of a button.

Through improving the efficiency of the NYPD's staff,

DAS has generated estimated savings of $50 million per year.   
Most importantly, the NYPD has used it to combat terrorism   
and improve its crime-fighting effectiveness. Since DAS was   
deployed department-wide in 2013, the overall crime index in   
the city has fallen by six percent.

[Tools and Software for Data Visualization](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#9)

Data visualization ranges from simple Excel charts to more advanced interactive tools and   
software that allow users to easily view and manipulate data with a few clicks, not only on   
computers, but also on iPads and other devices. In this chapter, we discuss basic tools avail-  
able in Excel. Commercial software packages such as Tableau, QlikView, and SAS Visual   
Analytics offer more powerful tools, especially for applications involving big data. In par-  
ticular, we suggest that you look at the capabilities of Tableau ([www.tableau.com)](http://www.tableau.com/), which   
we describe in the Appendix to this chapter. Tableau is easy to use and offers a free trial.

Microsoft Excel provides a comprehensive charting capability with many features. With a   
little experimentation, you can create professional charts for business analyses and presen-  
tations. These include vertical and horizontal bar charts, line charts, pie charts, area charts,

scatter plots, and many other special types of charts. We will not guide you through every   
application but do provide some guidance for new procedures as appropriate.

Certain charts work better for certain types of data, and using the wrong chart can make

the data difficult for the user to interpret and understand. While Excel offers many ways   
to make charts unique and fancy, naive users often focus more on the attention-grabbing   
aspects of charts rather than their effectiveness in displaying information. So we recom-  
mend that you keep charts simple, and avoid such bells and whistles as 3-D bars, cylinders,   
cones, and so on. We highly recommend books written by Stephen Few, such as

*Show Me*

*the Numbers*

(Oakland, CA: Analytics Press, 2004), for additional guidance in developing

effective data visualizations.

To create a chart in Excel, it is best to first highlight the range of the data you wish to

chart. The Excel Help files provide guidance on formatting your data for a particular type   
of chart. Click the

*Insert*

tab in the Excel ribbon [(Figure 3.3;](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#118)the Mac ribbon is similar).

Click the chart type, and then click a chart subtype that you want to use. Once a basic chart   
is created, you may use the options in the

*Design*

tab, you can change the type of chart,

data included in the chart, chart layout, and styles. The

*Format*

tab provides various for-

matting options. You may also customize charts easily by right clicking on elements of the   
chart or by using the

*Quick Layout*

options within the

*Design*

tab.

You should realize that up to 10% of the male population are affected by color blind-

ness, making it difficult to distinguish between different color variations. Although we   
generally display charts using Excel's default colors, which often, unfortunately, use red,   
experts suggest using blue-orange palettes. We suggest that you be aware of this for profes-  
sional and commercial applications.

[Column and Bar Charts](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#9)

Excel distinguishes between vertical and horizontal bar charts, calling the former

**column**

**charts**

and the latter

**bar charts**

. A

*clustered column chart*

compares values across cat-

egories using vertical rectangles; a

*stacked column chart*

displays the contribution of each

value to the total by stacking the rectangles; and a

*100% stacked column chart*

compares

the percentage that each value contributes to a total. Column and bar charts are useful for   
comparing categorical or ordinal data, for illustrating differences between sets of values,   
and for showing proportions or percentages of a whole.

Be cautious when changing the scale of the numerical axis. The heights or lengths of

the bars only accurately reflect the data values if the axis starts at zero. If not, the relative   
sizes can paint a misleading picture of the true relative values of the data.

interpret if the magnitude of the data values differs greatly. In that case, it would be advis-  
able to create separate charts for each data series.

Data visualization professionals don't recommend using pie charts. For example, con-

trast the pie chart [in Figure 3.11 with](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#122)the column chart [in Figure 3.12 for](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#122)the same data. In   
the pie chart, it is difficult to compare the relative sizes of areas; however, the bars in the   
column chart can easily be compared to determine relative ratios of the data. If you do use   
pie charts, restrict them to small numbers of categories, always ensure that the numbers add   
to 100%, and use labels to display the group names and actual percentages. Avoid three-  
dimensional (3-D) pie charts---especially those that are rotated---and keep them simple.

[Area Charts](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#9)

An

**area chart**

combines the features of a pie chart with those of line charts. Area charts

present more information than pie or line charts alone but may clutter the observer's mind   
with too many details if too many data series are used; thus, they should be used with care.

Many applications of business analytics involve geographic data. For example, finding the   
best location for production and distribution facilities, analyzing regional sales perfor-  
mance, transporting raw materials and finished goods, and routing vehicles such as deliv-  
ery trucks involve geographic data. In such problems, data mapping can help in a variety of   
ways. Visualizing geographic data can highlight key data relationships, identify trends, and   
uncover business opportunities. In addition, it can often help to spot data errors and help   
end users understand solutions, thus increasing the likelihood of acceptance of decision   
models. Companies like Nike use geographic data and information systems for visualizing   
where products are being distributed and how that relates to demographic and sales infor-  
mation. This information is vital to marketing strategies. The use of prescriptive analytic   
models in combination with data mapping was instrumental in the success of Procter \&   
Gamble's North American supply chain study, which saved the company in excess of $200   
million dollars per year.

monthly product sales for each product as green if they are   
in the top 20% of the data range, red if in the bottom 20%,

Sets

, and then select

More Rules

. In the

Rule

dialog, change the default values of 67 and 33% to 80

and 20%, as shown in the figure. To understand how this

works, look at product B. The minimum value is 3,024 and   
the maximum is 5,991. So 80% is 3024 + 0.8 × (5991 − 3024)   
= 5397.6. Thus, any cell value above this is coded as green.   
Similarly, 20% is 3024 + 0.2 × (5991 − 3024) = 3617.4; any   
cell value below this is coded as red. In the

Edit Formatting

Rule

dialog, you may also change the rule to code the cells

based on their actual values by changing

Percent

to

Sparklines are graphics that summarize a row or column of data in a single cell. Spar-  
klines were introduced by Edward Tufte, a famous expert on visual presentation of data.   
He described sparklines as "data-intense, design-simple, word-sized graphics." Excel has   
three types of sparklines: line, column, and win/loss. Line sparklines are useful for time-  
series data, while column sparklines are more appropriate for categorical data. Win/loss   
sparklines are useful for data that move up or down over time. They are found in the

G, we display column sparklines, which are essentially small   
column charts. Generally, you need to expand the row or col-  
umn widths to display them effectively. Notice, however, that   
the lengths of the bars are not scaled properly to the data;   
for example, in the first one, products D and E are roughly   
one-third the value of product E, yet the bars are not scaled   
correctly. Excel defaults to automatic scaling of the minimum   
and maximum values of the vertical axis. You can change this

Making data visible and accessible to employees at all levels is a hallmark of effective   
modern organizations. A

**dashboard**

is a visual representation of a set of key business

measures. It is derived from the analogy of an automobile's control panel, which displays   
speed, gasoline level, temperature, and so on. Dashboards provide important summaries   
of key business information to help manage a business process or function. For example,   
the Cincinnati Zoo [(see the introduction in Chapter 1)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30) uses hourly, daily, and yearly dash-  
boards that show such metrics as attendance and types of admission, cities where visitors   
come from, and revenue at different food and retail locations.

Dashboards are particularly useful for senior managers who don't have the time to sift

through large amounts of data and need a summary of the state of business performance   
during monthly or quarterly reviews. Dashboards might include tabular as well as visual   
data to allow managers to quickly locate ke[y data. Figure 3.28 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#132)ws a simple dashboard   
for the product sales data [in Figure 3.1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#116)Dashboards often incorporate color scales or icon   
sets to quickly pinpoint areas of concern. This one displays the monthly sales for each   
product individually, sales of all products combined, total annual sales by product, a com-  
parison of the last two months, and monthly percent changes by product.

An effective dashboard should capture all the key information that the users need

for making good decisions. Important business metrics are often called

**key performance**

**indicators (KPIs)**

. People tend to look at data at the top left first, so the most important

charts should be positioned there. An important principle in dashboard design is to keep   
it simple---don't clutter the dashboard with too much information or use formats (such as   
3-D charts) that don't clearly convey information.

Chapter 3

Data Visualization

Founded in the 1930s and headquartered in Ballinger,   
Texas, Mueller is a leading retailer and manufacturer of   
pre-engineered metal buildings and metal roofing products.   
Today, the company sells its products directly to consum-  
ers all over the southwestern United States from 35 loca-  
tions across Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.

Historically, Mueller saw itself first and foremost as a

manufacturer; the retail aspects of the business were a sec-  
ondary focus. However, in the early 2000s, the company   
decided to shift the focus of its strategy and become much   
more retail-centric---getting closer to its end-use custom-  
ers and driving new business through a better understand-  
ing of their needs. To achieve its transformation objective,   
the company needed to communicate its retail strategy to   
employees across the organization.

As Mark Lack, Manager of Strategy Analytics and

Business Intelligence at Mueller, explains: "The transforma-  
tion from pure manufacturing to retail-led manufacturing   
required a more end-customer-focused approach to sales.   
We wanted a way to track how successfully our sales teams   
across the country were adapting to this new strategy, and   
identify where improvements could be made."

To keep track of sales performance, Mueller worked

with IBM to deploy IBM Cognos Business Intelligence. The   
IBM team helped Mueller apply technology to its balanced   
scorecard process for strategy management in Cognos   
Metric Studio.

By using a common set of KPIs, Mueller can eas-

ily identify the strengths and weaknesses of all of its sales   
teams through sales performance analytics. "Using Metric   
Studio in Cognos Business Intelligence, we get a clear pic-  
ture of each team's strategy performance," says Mark Lack.   
"Using sales performance insights from Cognos score-  
cards, we can identify teams that are hitting their targets,   
and determine the reasons for their success. We can then   
share this knowledge with underperforming teams, and   
demonstrate how they can change their way of working to   
meet their targets."

Instead of just trying to impose or enforce new ways

of working, we are able to show sales teams exactly how   
they are contributing to the business, and explain what they

need to do to improve their metrics. It's a much more effec-  
tive way of driving the changes in behavior that are vital for   
business transformation."

Recently, IBM Business Analytics Software Services

helped Mueller upgrade to IBM Cognos 10. With the new   
version in place, Mueller has started using a new feature   
called Business Insight to empower regional sales man-  
agers to track and improve the performance of their sales   
teams by creating their own personalized dashboards.

"Static reports are a good starting point, but people

don't enjoy reading through pages of data to find the infor-  
mation they need," comments Mark Lack. "The new version   
of Cognos gives us the ability to create customized interac-  
tive dashboards that give each user immediate insight into   
their own specific area of the business, and enable them to   
drill down into the raw data if they need to. It's a much more   
intuitive and compelling way of using information."

Mueller now uses Cognos to investigate the reasons

why some products sell better in certain areas, which of its   
products have the highest adoption rates, and which have   
the biggest margins. Using these insights, the company can   
adapt its strategy to ensure that it markets the right prod-  
ucts to the right customers---increasing sales.

By using IBM SPSS Modeler to mine enormous vol-

umes of transactional data, the company aims to reveal   
patterns and trends that will help to predict future risks   
and opportunities, as well as uncover unseen problems   
and anomalies in its current operations. One initial project   
with IBM SPSS Modeler aims to help Mueller find ways to   
reduce its fuel costs. Using SPSS Modeler, the company is   
building a sophisticated statistical model that will automate   
the process of analyzing fuel transactions for hundreds of   
vehicles, drivers, and routes.

"With SPSS Modeler, we will be able to determine the

average fuel consumption for each vehicle on each route over   
the course of a week," says Mark Lack. "SPSS will automati-  
cally flag up any deviations from the average consumption,   
and we then drill down to find the root cause. The IBM solution   
helps us to determine if higher-than-usual fuel transactions   
are legitimate---for example, a driver covering extra miles---or   
the result of some other factor, such as fraud."

**Part 1:**

PLE originally produced lawn mowers, but a

significant portion of sales volume over recent years has   
come from the growing small-tractor market. As we noted   
in the case in[Chapter 1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30), PLE sells their products worldwide,   
with sales regions including North America, South America,   
Europe, and the Pacific Rim. Three years ago, a new region   
was opened to serve China, where a booming market for   
small tractors has been established. PLE has always empha-  
sized quality and considers the quality it builds into its prod-  
ucts as its primary selling point. In the past two years, PLE   
has also emphasized the ease of use of their products.

Before digging into the details of operations, Eliza-

beth Burke wants to gain an overview of PLE's overall   
business performance and market position by examining   
the information provided in the database for this com-  
pany. Specifically, she is asking you to construct appropri-  
ate charts for the data in the following worksheets in the

*Performance Lawn Equipment Database*

and summarize

your conclusions from analysis of these charts.

a.

*Dealer Satisfaction*

b.

*End-User Satisfaction*

c.

*Complaints*

d.

*Mower Unit Sales*

e.

*Tractor Unit Sales*

f.

*On-Time Delivery*

g.

*Defects After Delivery*

h.

*Response Time*

**Part 2:**

Propose a monthly dashboard of the most important

business information that Ms. Burke can use on a routine   
basis as data are updated. Create one using the most recent   
data. Your dashboard should not consist of more than six to   
eight charts, which should fit comfortably on one screen.

Write a formal report summarizing your results for both   
parts of this case.

15.

Apply three different colors of data bars to lunch, din-  
ner, and delivery sales in the Excel file

*Restaurant Sales*

to visualize the relative amounts of sales. Then sort the   
data by the day of the week beginning on Sunday. Com-  
pare the nonsorted data with the sorted data and com-  
ment on the information content of the visualizations.

16.

For the

*Store and Regional Sales*

database, apply a

four-traffic-light icon set to visualize the distribu-  
tion of the number of units sold for each store, where   
green corresponds to at least 30 units sold, yellow to   
at least 20 but less than 30, red to at least 10 but less   
than 20, and black to below 10.

17.

For the Excel file

*Closing Stock Prices*

,

a.

apply both column and line sparklines to visual-  
ize the trends in the prices for each of the four   
stocks in the file.

b.

compute the daily change in the Dow Jones index   
and apply a win/loss sparkline to visualize the   
daily up or down movement in the index.

Dashboards

18.

Create a useful dashboard for the data in the Excel   
file

*President's Inn Guest Database*

. Use the addi-

tional information stated in Problem 20 of [Chap-
ter 2:](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#76)Room rates are the same for one or two guests;

however, additional guests must pay an additional   
$20 per person per day for meals. Guests staying for   
seven days or more receive a 10% discount. Modify   
the spreadsheet to calculate the number of days that   
each party stayed at the inn and the total revenue for   
the length of stay. Use appropriate charts and layouts   
and other visualization tools that help to convey the   
information. Explain why you chose the elements of   
the dashboard and how a manager might use them.

In this appendix, we describe some additional charts that are only available in the Windows   
version of Excel 2016 and also illustrate the capabilities of Tableau, a powerful software   
package for data visualization.

[Hierarchy Charts](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#9)

Hierarchical data are organized in a tree-like structure. A simple example is the

*Purchase*

*Orders*

database. At the top level we have suppliers; at the next level we have the items

purchased; then the order quantity or cost per order, and so on. A

**treemap chart**

divides

the chart area into rectangles that represent different levels and relative sizes of hierarchi-  
cal data. Each rectangle is subdivided into smaller rectangles representing the next level   
in the hierarchy. Rectangles at the top level of the hierarchy are arranged with the largest   
in the upper left corner of the chart to the smallest in the lower right corner. Within a rect-  
angle, the next level of the hierarchy is also arranged with rectangles from the upper left   
to the lower right.

E X A M P L E A 3 . 1

A Treemap for Purchase Order Data

For the

Purchase Orders

database, we used a PivotTable

to create a new worksheet showing the items purchased   
from each supplier and the total cost of the orders. High-  
light the data and select

Insert Hierarchy Chart

from the

Charts

group on the

Insert

tab. [Figure A3.1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#138) shows the

result. We see that the largest order costs come from   
Hulkey Fasteners, followed by Durrable Products, Steel-  
pin Inc., and so on. Within each colored area you can also   
see the relative sizes of the orders from each supplier.

An alternative to a treemap chart is a

**sunburst chart**

. In this chart, the hierarchy is

represented by a series of circles, with the highest level of the hierarchy in the center and   
lower levels of the hierarchy as rings displayed outside the center. The lowest level of the   
hierarch[y is the outside ring. Figure A3.2 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#138)ws a sunburst chart for the

*Purchase Orders*

data in the previous example.

Waterfall Charts

A

**waterfall chart**

shows a running total as values are added or subtracted. A common

application of waterfall charts is to show the impact of positive or negative cash flows on   
net income or profit.

PivotCharts make it easy to create dashboards. However, you should consider what

message you are trying to convey in choosing the design of Piv[otCharts. In Figure A3.4,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#140)for instance, it is easier to compare product sales within a region, while in [Figure A3.5,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#140)which was created by reversing the order of region and product in the

*Rows*

area, it is eas-

ier to compare regional sales for a given product. PivotCharts are also highly effective in   
oral presentations since the

*Filter*

buttons allow you to drill down into the data to respond

to questions from the audience.

Tableau ([www.tableau.com](http://www.tableau.com/)) is professional business intelligence software that facilitates   
data visualization using intuitive drag-and-drop capabilities. It can be used for spread-  
sheets as well as other types of database formats such as geographic data and has the power   
to handle big data easily. It also applies best practices in data visualization and facilitates   
the development of dashboards, which can easily be published and shared on the web and   
on mobile devices. We briefly illustrate some of its basic capabilities.

[Figure A3.6](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#141)shows the window for the

displays SUM(Cost per order) as shown in the green oval. From a drop-down menu, you   
can change this to average, count, minimum, maximum, and other measures, similar to   
changing the field settings in a PivotTable.

The

*Show Me*

window provides one-click visualizations for a wide variety of charts,

including common bar, column, and pie charts, along with more advanced charts such   
as treemaps and heat maps. Tableau intelligently shows only those charts that apply to   
the data and hides the others (grayed out). [Figure A3.7](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#141)shows a stacked bar chart, and

Chapter 4

Descriptive Statistics

Statistics, as defined by David Hand, past president of the Royal Statistical Soci-

ety in the UK, is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting

information from data.

1

Statistics involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, inter-

preting, and presenting data. A

statistic

is a summary measure of data. You are

undoubtedly familiar with the concept of statistics in daily life as reported in the

media: baseball batting averages, airline on-time arrival performance, and eco-

nomic statistics such as the Consumer Price Index are just a few examples. Sta-

tistics helps to understand and quantify uncertainty in data and to incorporate

uncertainty for predicting the future.

You have undoubtedly been using statistics informally for many years.

Numerical measures, such as your GPA, average incomes, and housing prices,

are examples of statistics. While we see averages all the time in sports, finance,

and marketing, these are only the tip of the iceberg. Statistics is much more than

just computing averages. Statistics provides the means of gaining insight---both

numerically and visually---into large quantities of data, understanding uncertainty

and risk, and drawing conclusions from sample data that come from very large

populations. For example, marketing analysts employ statistics extensively to

analyze survey data to understand brand loyalty and satisfaction with goods and

services, to segment customers into groups for targeted ads, and to identify fac-

tors that drive consumer demand; finance personnel use statistics to evaluate

stock and mutual fund performance in order to identify good investment oppor-

tunities and to evaluate changes in foreign currency rates; and operations man-

agers use statistics to gauge production and quality performance to determine

process and design improvements. You will find yourself routinely using many of

the statistical concepts in this chapter in your daily work.

Statistical methods are essential to business analytics and are used through-

out this book. Microsoft Excel supports statistical analysis in two ways:

1.

with statistical functions that are entered in worksheet cells directly or

embedded in formulas

2.

with the Excel

Analysis Toolpak

add-in to perform more complex statistical

computations. While previous versions of Excel for Mac did not support

the

Analysis Toolpak

, Excel 2016 now includes it.

We use both statistical functions and the

Analysis Toolpak

in many examples.

Descriptive statistics

refers to methods of describing and summarizing data

using tabular, visual, and quantitative techniques. In this chapter, we focus on

both tabular and visual methods, as well as quantitative measures for statistical

analysis of data. We begin with a discussion of different types of metrics and

ways to classify data.

The science of statistics is vitally important to health care   
decision makers. Descriptive statistics summarize the util-  
ity, efficacy, and costs of medical goods and services.   
Increasingly, health care organizations employ statistical   
analysis to measure their performance outcomes. Some   
examples include the following:

Descriptive statistics summarize the utility, efficacy,   
and costs of medical goods and services. For exam-  
ple, government health and human service agencies   
gauge the overall health and well-being of populations   
with statistical information.

■

■

Hospitals and other large provider service organi-  
zations implement data-driven, continuous quality   
improvement programs to maximize efficiency. Statis-  
tics are important to health care companies in mea-  
suring performance success or failure. By establishing   
benchmarks, or standards of service excellence, qual-  
ity improvement managers can measure future out-  
comes. Analysts map the overall growth and viability of   
a health care company by using statistical data gath-  
ered over time.

Researchers gather data on human population samples.   
The health care industry benefits from knowing consumer   
market characteristics such as age, sex, race, income,   
and disabilities. These demographic statistics can predict   
the types of services that people are using and the level of   
care that is affordable to them.

■

■

Statistical information is invaluable in determining what   
combination of goods and services to produce, which   
resources to allocate in producing them, and to which   
populations to offer them.

■

■

Public and private health care administrators, charged   
with providing continuums of care to diverse populations,   
compare existing services to community needs. Statistical   
analysis is a critical component in a needs assessment.   
Statistics is equally important to pharmaceutical and tech-  
nology companies in developing product lines that meet   
the needs of the populations they serve.

Innovative medicine begins and, sometimes, ends with   
statistical analysis. Data are collected and carefully   
reported in clinical trials of new technologies and treat-  
ments to weigh products' benefits against their risks.

Descriptive Statistics

[Metrics and Data Classification](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

A

**metric**

is a unit of measurement that provides a way to objectively quantify perfor-

mance. For example, senior managers might assess overall business performance using   
such metrics as net profit, return on investment, market share, and customer satisfaction. A   
plant manager might monitor such metrics as the proportion of defective parts produced or   
the number of inventory turns each month. For a Web-based retailer, some useful metrics   
are the percentage of orders filled accurately and the time taken to fill a customer's order.

**Measurement**

is the act of obtaining data associated with a metric.

**Measures**

are numeri-

cal values associated with a metric.

Metrics can be either discrete or continuous. A

**discrete metric**

is one that is derived

from counting something. For example, a delivery is either on time or not; an order is   
complete or incomplete; or an invoice can have one, two, three, or any number of errors.   
Some discrete metrics associated with these examples would be the number of on-time   
deliveries, the number of incomplete orders each day, and the number of errors per invoice.

**Continuous metrics**

are based on a continuous scale of measurement. Any metrics involv-

ing dollars, length, time, volume, or weight, for example, are continuous.

Another classification of data is by the type of measurement scale. Data may be clas-

sified into four groups:

**1. Categorical (nominal) data**

, which are sorted into categories according to

specified characteristics. For example, a firm's customers might be classified   
by their geographical region (e.g., North America, South America, Europe, and   
Pacific); employees might be classified as managers, supervisors, and associ-  
ates. The categories bear no quantitative relationship to one another, but we   
usually assign an arbitrary number to each category to ease the process of man-  
aging the data and computing statistics. Categorical data are usually counted or   
expressed as proportions or percentages.

**2. Ordinal data**

, which can be ordered or ranked according to some relationship to

one another. College football or basketball rankings are ordinal; a higher ranking   
signifies a stronger team but does not specify any numerical measure of strength.   
Ordinal data are more meaningful than categorical data because data can be com-  
pared. A common example in business is data from survey scales---for example,   
rating a service as poor, average, good, very good, or excellent. Such data are   
categorical but also have a natural order (excellent is better than very good) and,   
consequently, are ordinal. However, ordinal data have no fixed units of measure-  
ment, so we cannot make meaningful numerical statements about differences   
between categories. Thus, we cannot say that the difference between excellent   
and very good is the same as between good and average, for example. Similarly,   
a team ranked number 1 may be far superior to the number 2 team, whereas there   
may be little difference between teams ranked 9th and 10th.

**3. Interval data**

, which are ordinal but have constant differences between obser-

vations and have arbitrary zero points. Common examples are time and temper-  
ature. Time is relative to global location, and calendars have arbitrary starting   
dates (compare, for example, the standard Gregorian calendar with the Chinese   
calendar). Both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales represent a specified measure   
of distance---degrees---but have arbitrary zero points. Thus we cannot compute   
meaningful ratios; for example, we cannot say that 50 degrees is twice as hot   
as 25 degrees. However, we can compare differences. Another example is SAT   
or GMAT scores. The scores can be used to rank students, but only differences  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive148.png)

Chapter 4

Descriptive Statistics

between scores provide information on how much better one student performed   
over another; ratios make little sense. In contrast to ordinal data, interval data   
allow meaningful comparison of ranges, averages, and other statistics.

In business, data from survey scales, while technically ordinal, are often

treated as interval data when numerical scales are associated with categories (for   
instance, 1

=

poor, 2

=

average, 3

=

good, 4

=

very good, 5

=

excellent).

Strictly speaking, this is not correct because the "distance" between catego-  
ries may not be perceived as the same (respondents might perceive a larger gap   
between poor and average than between good and very good, for example). Nev-  
ertheless, many users of survey data treat them as interval when analyzing the   
data, particularly when only a numerical scale is used without descriptive labels.

**4. Ratio data**

, which are continuous and have a natural zero point. Most business

and economic data, such as dollars and time, fall into this category. For example,   
the measure dollars has an absolute zero. Ratios of dollar figures are meaningful.   
For example, knowing that the Seattle region sold $12 million in March whereas   
the Tampa region sold $6 million means that Seattle sold twice as much as Tampa.

This classification is hierarchical in that each level includes all the information content

of the one preceding it. For example, ordinal data are also categorical, and ratio information   
can be converted to any of the other types of data. Interval information can be converted to   
ordinal or categorical data but cannot be converted to ratio data without the knowledge of   
the absolute zero point. Thus, a ratio scale is the strongest form of measurement.

purchased over the past three months. The data provide the   
supplier; order number; item number, description, and cost;   
quantity ordered; cost per order; the suppliers' accounts   
payable (A/P) terms; and the order and arrival dates. We   
may classify each of these types of data as follows:

of delivery and rank the suppliers (thus creating ordinal data)   
by this metric.

A

**frequency distribution**

is a table that shows the number of observations in each of sev-

eral nonoverlapping groups. A graphical depiction of a frequency distribution in the form   
of a column chart is called a

**histogram**

. Frequency distributions and histograms summa-

rize basic characteristics of data, such as where the data are centered and how broadly data   
are dispersed. This is usually the first step in using descriptive statistics. In this section, we   
discuss how to create them for both categorical and numerical data.

Categorical variables naturally define the groups in a frequency distribution. For example, in   
the

EXAMPLE 4.2

Constructing a Frequency Distribution for Items in   
the

Purchase Orders

Database

First, list the item names in a column on the spreadsheet.   
We used column A, starting in cell A100, below the existing   
data array. It is important to use the exact names as used in   
the data file. To count the number of orders placed for each   
item, use the function

=

COUNTIF($D$4:$D$97,

cell_refer-

ence

), where

cell_reference

is the cell containing the item

name, in this case, cell A101. This is shown in[Figure 4.2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#150)

The resulting frequency distribution for the items is shown   
in [Figure 4.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#150). Thus, the company placed 14 orders for   
airframe fasteners and 11 orders for the bolt-nut package.   
We may also construct a column chart to visualize these   
frequencies, as shown in [Figure 4.4](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#150). We might wish to sort   
these using Pareto analysis to gain more insight into the   
order frequency.

O-ring

To construct a frequency distribution, we need only count the number of observations that   
appear in each category. This can be done using the Excel COUNTIF function.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive150.png)

We may express the frequencies as a fraction, or proportion, of the total; this is called the

**relative frequency**

. If a data set has

*n*

observations, the relative frequency of category

*i*

is

computed as

Relative Frequency of Category

*i*

=

Frequency of Category

*i*

*n*

**( 4 . 1 )**

We often multiply the relative frequencies by 100 to express them as percentages. A

**relative frequency distribution**

is a tabular summary of the relative frequencies of all

categories.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive151.png)

For numerical data that consist of a small number of values, we may construct a frequency   
distribution similar to the way we did for categorical data; that is, we simply use COUNTIF   
to count the frequencies of each value.

EXAMPLE 4.3

Constructing a Relative Frequency Distribution   
for Items in the

Purchase Orders

Database

The calculations for relative frequencies are simple. First,   
sum the frequencies to find the total number (note that   
the sum of the frequencies must be the same as the total   
number of observations,

n

). Then divide the frequency of

[each category by this value. Figure 4.5 shows the relative](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#151)frequency distribution for the purchase order items. The for-  
mula in cell C101, for example, is

=

B101/

$

B

$

114. You then

copy this formula down the column to compute the other   
relative frequencies. Note that the sum of the relative fre-  
quencies must equal 1.0. A pie chart of the frequencies   
is sometimes used to show these proportions visually,   
although it is more appealing for a smaller number of   
categories. For a large number of categories, a column or   
bar chart would work better, as we noted in Chapter 3.

EXAMPLE 4.4

Frequency and Relative Frequency Distribution for A/P Terms

In the

Purchase Orders

data, the A/P terms are all whole

numbers: 15, 25, 30, and 45. A frequency and relative fre-  
[quency distribution for these data are shown in Figure 4.6.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#151)

A bar chart showing the proportions, or relative fre-

[quencies, in Figure 4.7, clearly shows that the majority of](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#152)orders had accounts payable terms of 30 months.

If you do not specify a

have discrete values, set up a column of these values in your spreadsheet for the bin range

For numerical data that have many different discrete values with little repetition or are con-  
tinuous, we usually group the data into "bins." A grouped frequency distribution requires   
that we specify

**1.**

the number of groups,

**2.**

the width of each group, and

**3.**

the upper and lower limits of each group.

It is important to remember that the groups may not overlap, so that each value is counted   
in exactly one group.

You should define the groups after examining the range of the data. Generally, you

should choose between 5 and 15 groups, and the range of each should be equal. The more   
data you have, the more groups you should generally use. Note that with fewer groups, the   
group widths will be wider. Wider group widths provide a "coarse" histogram. Sometimes   
you need to experiment to find the best number of groups to provide a useful visualiza-  
tion of the data. Choose the lower limit of the first group (LL) as a whole number smaller   
than the minimum data value and the upper limit of the last group (UL) as a whole number  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive154.png)

EXAMPLE 4.6

Constructing a Frequency Distribution and Histogram   
for Cost per Order

In this example, we apply the Excel

Histogram

tool to the

cost per order data in column G of the

Purchase Orders

database. The data range from a minimum of $68.75 to a   
maximum of $127,500. You can find this either by using   
the MIN and MAX functions or simply by sorting the data.   
To ensure that all the data will be included in some group,   
it makes sense to set the lower limit of the first group to $0   
and the upper limit of the last group to $130,000. Thus, if we   
select five groups, using[equation (4.2)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#154), the width of each   
group is

1

$130,000

-

2 \>

5

=

$26,000; if we choose ten

groups, the width is

1

$130,000

-

0

2 \>

10

=

$13,000. We

select five groups. Doing so, the bin range is specified as

Upper Group Limit

$ 0.00

$ 26,000.00

$ 52,000.00

$ 78,000.00

$104,000.00

$130,000.00

This means that the first group includes all values less than   
or equal to $0; the second group includes all values greater   
than $0 but less than or equal to $26,000, and so on. Note   
that the groups do not overlap because the lower limit of   
one group is strictly greater than the upper limit of the pre-  
vious group. We suggest using the header "Upper Group   
Limit" for the bin range to make this clear. In the spread-  
sheet, this bin range is entered in cells G99:G105. The

Input Range

in the

Histogram

[dialog is G4:G97. Figure 4.11](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#154)

shows the results. These results show that the vast majority   
of orders were for $26,000 or less and fall rapidly beyond   
this value. Selecting a larger number of groups might help   
[to better understand the nature of the data. Figure 4.12](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#155)shows results using ten groups. This shows that there were   
a higher percentage of orders for $13,000 or less than for   
between $13,000 and $26,000.

Chapter 4

Descriptive Statistics

One limitation of the Excel

*Histogram*

tool is that the frequency distribution and

histogram are not linked to the data; thus, if you change any of the data, you must repeat   
the entire procedure to construct a new frequency distribution and histogram.

[Cumulative Relative Frequency Distributions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

For numerical data, we may also compute the relative frequency of observations in each   
group. By summing all the relative frequencies at or below each upper limit, we obtain   
the cumulative relative frequency. The

**cumulative relative frequency**

represents the pro-

portion of the total number of observations that fall at or below the upper limit of each   
group. A tabular summary of cumulative relative frequencies is called a

**cumulative rela-**

**tive frequency distribution**

.

relative frequency distributions for the cost per order data in   
the

database using ten groups. The rela-

tive frequencies are computed using the same approach   
as in[Example 4.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#151)---namely, by dividing the frequency by   
the total number of observations (94). In column D, we set   
the cumulative relative frequency of the first group equal to   
its relative frequency. Then we add the relative frequency

of the next group to the cumulative relative frequency. For   
example, the cumulative relative frequency in cell D3 is   
computed as

=

D2

C3

=

0.000

0.7234, and so on. Because

relative frequencies must be between 0 and 1 and must   
add up to 1, the cumulative frequency for the last group   
must equal 1.

[Figure 4.14](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#156) shows a chart for the cumulative relative frequency, which is called an

**ogive**

. From this chart, you can easily estimate the proportion of observations that fall

below a certain value. For example, you can see that slightly more than 70% of the data fall   
at or below $26,000, about 90% of the data fall at or below $78,000, and so on. Note that   
cumulative frequencies can also be displayed using the

*Histogram*

tool.

PivotTables make it quite easy to construct frequency distributions. For example, in the   

*Purchase Orders*

data, we can simply build a PivotTable to find a count of the number

of orders for each item, resulting in the same summary we saw in [Figure 4.5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#151) With Excel   
for Windows, a PivotChart (see Appendix A3 in Chapter 3) will display the histogram. For   
continuous numerical data, we can also use PivotTables to construct a grouped frequency   
distribution.

Data are often expressed as

*percentiles*

and

*quartiles*

. You are no doubt familiar with

percentiles from standardized tests used for college or graduate school entrance e xaminations   
(SAT, ACT, GMAT, GRE, etc.). Percentiles specify the percent of other test takers who   
scored at or below the score of a particular individual. Generally speaking, the

***k***

**th**

**percentile**

is a value at or below which at least

*k*

percent of the observations lie. However,

the way by which percentiles are calculated is not standardized. The most common way to   
compute the

*k*

th percentile is to order the data values from smallest to largest and calculate

the rank of the

*k*

th percentile using the formula

*nk*

100

+

0.5

**( 4 . 3 )**

where

*n*

is the number of observations. Round this to the nearest integer, and take the value

corresponding to this rank as the

*k*

th percentile.

EXAMPLE 4.9

Computing Percentiles

In the

Purchase Orders

data, we have

n

=

94 observations.

The rank of the 90th percentile (

k

=

90) for the cost per

order data is computed as 94(90)

\>

100

+

0.5

=

85.1, or,

rounded, 85. The 85th ordered value is $74,375 and is the   
90th percentile. This means that 90% of the costs per order   
are less than or equal to $74,375, and 10% are higher.

Statistical software use different methods that often involve interpolating between

ranks instead of rounding, thus producing different results. The Excel function   
PERCENTILE.INC(

*array, k*

) computes the 100

\*

*k*

th percentile of data in the range

specified in the

*array*

field, where

*k*

is in the range 0 to 1, inclusive.

Excel also has a tool for sorting data from high to low and computing percentiles

associated with each value. Select

*Rank and Percentile*

from the

*Data Analysis*

menu in

the

*Data tab*

and specify the range of the data in the dialog. Be sure to check the

*Labels in*

*First Row*

box if your range includes a header in the spreadsheet.

that the Excel value of the 90th percentile that we computed   
in [Example 4.9](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#158)as $74,375 is the 90.3rd percentile value.

**Quartiles**

break the data into four parts. The 25th percentile is called the

*first quartile*

,

Q

1

; the 50th percentile is called the

*second quartile*

, Q

2

; the 75th percentile is called the

*third*

*quartile*

, Q

; and the 100th percentile is the

*fourth quartile*

, Q

4

. One-fourth of the data fall

below the first quartile, one-half are below the second quartile, and three-fourths are below the   
third quartile. We may compute quartiles using the Excel function QUARTILE.INC(

*array,*

*quart*

), where

*array*

specifies the range of the data and

*quart*

is a whole number between 1

and 4, designating the desired quartile.

percentile as $73,737.50, which is different from using

Descriptive Statistics

We can extend these ideas to other divisions of the data. For example,

*deciles*

divide

the data into ten sets: the 10th percentile, 20th percentile, and so on. All these types of   
measures are called

**data profiles**

, or

**fractiles**

.

EXAMPLE 4.12

Computing Quartiles in Excel

For the cost per order data in the

database,

we may use the Excel function

One of the most basic statistical tools used to summarize categorical data and examine   
the relationship between two categorical variables is cross-tabulation. A

**cross-tabulation**

is a tabular method that displays the number of observations in a data set for different   
subcategories of two categorical variables. A cross-tabulation table is often called a   

**contingency table**

. The subcategories of the variables must be mutually exclusive and

exhaustive, meaning that each observation can be classified into only one subcategory,   
and, taken together over all subcategories, they must constitute the complete data set.   
Cross-tabulations are commonly used in marketing research to provide insight into   
characteristics of different market segments using categorical variables such as gender,   
educational level, and marital status.

A cross-tabulation will have rows corresponding to the dif-  
ferent regions and columns corresponding to the products.   
Within the table we list the count of the number in each pair   
of categories. A cross-tabulation of these data is shown   
[in Table 4.1. PivotTables make it easy to construct cross-](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#160)tabulations. Visualizing the data as a chart is a good way

Expressing the results as percentages of a row or

column makes it easier to interpret differences between

regions or products, particularly as the totals for each   
category differ.[Table 4.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#160)shows the percentage of book   
and DVD sales within each region; this is computed by   
dividing the counts by the row totals and multiplying by   
100 (in Excel, simply divide the count by the total and   
format the result as a percentage by clicking the   
% button in the

in a PivotTable. For example, we see that although   
more books and DVDs are sold in the West region than   
in the North, the relative percentages of each product   
are similar, particularly when compared to the East and   
South regions.

In this section, we introduce numerical measures that provide an effective and efficient   
way of obtaining meaningful information from data. Before discussing these measures,   
however, we need to understand the differences between populations and samples.

is a subset of a population. For example, a list of individuals who rented

a comedy from Netflix in the past year would be a sample from the population of all   
customers. Whether this sample is representative of the population of customers---which   
depends on how the sample data are intended to be used---may be debatable; nevertheless,   
it is a sample. Most populations, even if they are finite, are generally too large to deal with   
effectively or practically. For instance, it would be impractical as well as too expensive to   
survey the entire population of TV viewers in the United States. Sampling is also clearly   
necessary when data must be obtained from destructive testing or from a continuous pro-  
duction process. Thus, the purpose of sampling is to obtain sufficient information to draw a   
valid inference about a population. Market researchers, for example, use sampling to gauge   
consumer perceptions on new or existing goods and services; auditors use sampling to   
verify the accuracy of financial statements; and quality-control analysts sample production   
output to verify quality levels and identify opportunities for improvement.

Most data with which businesses deal are samples. For instance, the

*Purchase Orders*

and

*Sales Transactions*

databases that we used in previous chapters represent samples

because the purchase order data include only orders placed within a three-month time

We typically label the elements of a data set using subscripted variables,

*x*

1

,

*x*

2

, and so

on. In general,

*x*

*i*

represents the

*i*

th observation. It is a common practice in statistics to

use Greek letters, such as

m

(mu),

s

(sigma), and

p

(pi), to represent population mea-

sures and italic letters such as

*x*

(

*x*

-bar),

*s*

, and

*p*

to represent sample statistics. We will

use

*N*

to represent the number of items in a population and

*n*

to represent the number

of observations in a sample. Statistical formulas often contain a summation operator,

Σ

(Greek capital sigma), which means that the terms that follow it are added together.

Thus,

Measures of location provide estimates of a single value that in some fashion represents   
the "centering" of a set of data. The most common is the

*average*

. We all use averages

routinely in our lives, for example, to measure student accomplishment in college (e.g.,   
grade point average), to measure the performance of athletes (e.g., batting average), and to   
measure performance in business (e.g., average delivery time).

Arithmetic Mean

The average is formally called the

**arithmetic mean**

(or simply the

**mean**

), which is the sum

of the observations divided by the number of observations. Mathematically, the mean of a   
population is denoted by the Greek letter

m

, and the mean of a sample is denoted by

*x*

. If a

population consists of

*N*

observations

*x*

1

,

*x*

2

,

c

,

*x*

*N*

, the population mean,

m

, is calculated as

m

The mean of a sample of

observations,

, denoted by

*x*

, is calculated as

*x*

=

a

*n*

*i*

*x*

*i*

*n*

**( 4 . 5 )**

Note that the calculations for the mean are the same whether we are dealing with a popula-  
tion or a sample; only the notation differs. We may also calculate the mean in Excel using   
the function AVERAGE(

*data range*

).

One property of the mean is that the sum of the deviations of each observation from

the mean is zero:

a

*i*

*x*

*i*

-

*x*

**( 4 . 6 )**

This simply means that the sum of the deviations above the mean is the same as the sum of   
the deviations below the mean; essentially, the mean "balances" the values on either side of

it. However, it does not suggest that half the data lie above or below the mean---a common   
misconception among those who don't understand statistics.

In addition, the mean is unique for every set of data and is meaningful for both interval

and ratio data. However, it can be affected by

**outliers**

---observations that are radically

different from the rest---which pull the value of the mean toward these values. We discuss   
more about outliers later in this chapter.

EXAMPLE 4.14

Computing the Mean Cost per Order

In the

Purchase Orders

database, suppose that we are

interested in finding the mean cost per order. We calculate   
the mean cost per order by summing the values in col-  
umn G and then dividing by the number of observations.   
[Using equation (4.5), note that](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#162)

Median

The measure of location that specifies the middle value when the data are arranged from least   
to greatest is the

**median**

. Half the data are below the median, and half the data are above it.

For an odd number of observations, the median is the middle of the sorted numbers. For an   
even number of observations, the median is the mean of the two middle numbers. We could   
use the

*Sort*

option in Excel to rank-order the data and then determine the median. The Excel

function MEDIAN(

*data range*

) could also be used. The median is meaningful for ratio,

interval, and ordinal data. As opposed to the mean, the median is

*not*

affected by outliers.

EXAMPLE 4.15

Finding the Median Cost per Order

In the

Purchase Orders

database, sort the data in column

G from smallest to largest. Since we have 94 observations,   
the median is the average of the 47th and 48th observa-  
tions. You should verify that the 47th sorted observation   
is $15,562.50 and the 48th observation is $15,750. Taking   
the average of these two values results in the median value

of ($15,562.5

+

$15,750)

\>

2

=

$15,656.25. Thus, we may

conclude that the costs of half the orders were less than   
$15,656.25 and half were above this amount. In this case,   
the median is not very close in value to the mean. These   
calculations are shown in the worksheet

Mode

A third measure of location is the

**mode**

. The mode is the observation that occurs most

frequently. The mode is most useful for data sets that contain a relatively small number   
of unique values. For data sets that have few repeating values, the mode does not pro-  
vide much practical value. You can easily identify the mode from a frequency distribution   
by identifying the value having the largest frequency or from a histogram by identifying   
the highest bar. You may also use the Excel function MODE.SNGL(

*data range*

). For fre-

quency distributions and histograms of grouped data, the mode is the group with the great-  
est frequency. Some data sets have multiple modes; to identify these, you can use the Excel   
function MODE.MULT(

*data range*

), which returns an array of modal values.

EXAMPLE 4.16

Finding the Mode

In the

Purchase Orders

database, from the frequency dis-

[tribution and histogram for A/P terms in Figure 4.10, we](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#153)see that the greatest frequency corresponds to a value of   
30 months; this is also the highest bar in the histogram.

Therefore, the mode is 30 months. For the grouped fre-  
quency distribution and histogram of the cost per order   
[variable in Figure 4.12, we see that the mode corresponds](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#155)to the group between $0 and $13,000.

Midrange

A fourth measure of location that is used occasionally is the

**midrange**

. This is simply the

average of the largest and smallest values in the data set.

EXAMPLE 4.17

Computing the Midrange

We may identify the minimum and maximum values using   
the Excel functions MIN and MAX or sort the data and find   
them easily. For the cost per order data, the minimum value

is $68.78 and the maximum value is $127,500. Thus, the   
midrange is ($127,500

+

$68.78)

\>

2

=

$63,784.39.

Caution must be exercised when using the midrange because extreme values easily

distort the result, as this example illustrates. This is because the midrange uses only two   
pieces of data, whereas the mean uses

*all*

the data; thus, it is usually a much rougher esti-

mate than the mean and is often used for only small sample sizes.

[Using Measures of Location in Business Decisions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

Because everyone is so familiar with the concept of the average in daily life, managers often   
use the mean inappropriately in business when other statistical information should be consid-  
ered. The following hypothetical example, which was based on a real situation, illustrates this.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive165.png)

EXAMPLE 4.18

Quoting Computer Repair Times

The Excel file

Computer Repair Times

provides a sample

of the times it took to repair and return 250 computers to   
customers who used the repair services of a national elec-  
tronics retailer. Computers are shipped to a central facility,   
where they are repaired and then shipped back to the stores   
for customer pickup. The mean, median, and mode are all   
very close and show that the typical repair time is about two   
weeks (see [Figure 4.23)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#165). So you might think that if a cus-  
tomer brought in a computer for repair, it would be reason-  
able to quote a repair time of two weeks. What would happen   
if the stores quoted all customers a time of two weeks?   
Clearly about half the customers would be upset because   
their computers would not be completed by this time.

[Figure 4.24](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#165)shows a portion of the frequency dis-

tribution and histogram for these repair times (see the

Histogram

tab in the Excel file). We see that the l ongest

repair time took almost six weeks. So should the   
company give customers a guaranteed repair time of six   
weeks? They probably wouldn't have many customers   
because few would want to wait that long. Instead, the   
frequency distribution and histogram provide insight into   
making a more rational decision. You may verify that   
90% of the time, repairs are completed within 21 days;   
on the rare occasions that it takes longer, it generally   
means that technicians had to order and wait for a part.   
So it would make sense to tell customers that they could   
probably expect their computers back within two to   
three weeks and inform them that it might take longer if   
a special part was needed.

From this example, we see that using frequency distributions, histograms, and percen-

tiles can provide more useful information than simple measures of location. This leads us to   
introduce ways of quantifying variability in data, which we call

*measures of dispersion*

.

[Measures of Dispersion: Range, Interquartile Range,
Variance, and Standard Deviation](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

**Dispersion**

refers to the degree of variation in the data, that is, the numerical spread (or

compactness) of the data. Several statistical measures characterize dispersion: the

*range*

,

*interquartile range*

,

*variance*

, and

*standard deviation*

.

Range

The

**range**

is the easiest to compute, and is the difference between the maximum value and the

minimum value in the data set. Although Excel does not provide a function for the range, it   
can be computed easily by the formula

=

MAX(

*data*

*range*

)

-

MIN(

*data*

*range*

). Like the

midrange, the range is affected by outliers and, thus, is often only used for very small data sets.

EXAMPLE 4.19

Computing the Range

For the cost per order data in the

Purchase Orders

database, the minimum value is $68.78 and the

maximum value is $127,500. Thus, the range is   
$127,500

-

$68.78

=

$127,431.22.

Interquartile Range

The difference between the first and third quartiles,

*Q*

3

-

*Q*

1

, is often called the

**inter-**

**quartile range (IQR)**

, or the

**midspread**

. This includes only the middle 50% of the data

and, therefore, is not influenced by extreme values. Thus, it is sometimes used as an alter-  
native measure of dispersion.

EXAMPLE 4.20

Computing the Interquartile Range

For the cost per order data in the

Purchase Orders

database, we identified the first and third quartiles as

Q

1

=

$6,757.81 and

Q

3

=

$27,593.75[in Example 4.12.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#159)

Thus, IQR

=

$27,593.75

-

$6,757.81

=

$20,835.94.

Therefore, the middle 50% of the data are concentrated

over a relatively small range of $20,835.94. Note that the   
upper 25% of the data span the range from $27,593.75 to   
$127,500, indicating that high costs per order are spread   
out over a large range of $99,906.25.

Variance

A more commonly used measure of dispersion is the

**variance**

, whose computation

depends on

*all*

the data. The larger the variance, the more the data are spread out from the

mean and the more variability one can expect in the observations. The formula used for   
calculating the variance is different for populations and samples.

The formula for the variance of a population is

where

*x*

*i*

is the value of the

*i*

th item,

*N*

is the number of items in the population, and

m

is

the population mean. Essentially, the variance is the average of the squared deviations of   
the observations from the mean.

A significant difference exists between the formulas for computing the variance of a

population and that of a sample. The variance of a sample is calculated using the formula

where

*n*

is the number of items in the sample and

*x*

is the sample mean. It may seem pecu-

liar to use a different denominator to "average" the squared deviations from the mean for   
populations and samples, but statisticians have shown that the formula for the sample vari-  
ance provides a more accurate representation of the true population variance. We discuss   
[this more formally in Chapter 6.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#248) For now, simply understand that the proper calculations   
of the population and sample variance use different denominators based on the number of   
observations in the data.

The Excel function VAR.S(

*data range*

) may be used to compute the sample variance,

calculate the mean, as was done in [Example 4.14.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#163) Then   
for each observation, calculate the difference between the

observation and the mean, as shown in column C. Next,   
square these differences, as shown in column D. Finally, add   
these square deviations (cell D96) and divide by

Excel Calculations for   
Variance of Cost per Order

Note that the dimension of the variance is the square of the dimension of the observa-

tions. So for example, the variance of the cost per order is not expressed in dollars, but   
rather in dollars squared. This makes it difficult to use the variance in practical applica-  
tions. However, a measure closely related to the variance that can be used in practical   
applications is the standard deviation.

tion. Thus, the standard deviation of the cost per order is

=

$29,842.8312. Alternatively, we could

use the Excel function

=

STDEV.S(B2:B95) to find the

same value.

The standard deviation is generally easier to interpret than the variance because its

units of measure are the same as the units of the data. Thus, it can be more easily related to   
the mean or other statistics measured in the same units.

The standard deviation is a popular measure of risk, particularly in financial analysis,

because many people associate risk with volatility in stock prices. The standard deviation   
measures the tendency of a fund's monthly returns to vary from their long-term average (as

*Fortune*

stated in one of its issues, ". . . standard deviation tells you what to expect in the

way of dips and rolls. It tells you how scared you'll be.").

4

For example, a mutual fund's

return might have averaged 11% with a standard deviation of 10%. Thus, about two-thirds   
of the time, the annualized monthly return was between 1% and 21%. By contrast, another   
fund's average return might be 14% but have a standard deviation of 20%. Its returns would   
have fallen in a range of

-

6% to 34% and, therefore, it is more risky. Many financial Web

sites, such as [IFA.com](http://ifa.com/) and [Morningstar.com,](http://morningstar.com/) provide standard deviations for market   
indexes and mutual funds.

similar, $18.81 and $16.19, respectively. However, the standard deviation of Intel's price   
over this time frame was $0.50, whereas GE's was $0.35. GE had less variability and,   
therefore, less risk. A larger standard deviation implies that while a greater potential of a   
higher return exists, there is also greater risk of realizing a lower return. Many investment   
publications and Web sites provide standard deviations of stocks and mutual funds to help   
investors assess risk in this fashion. We learn more about risk in other chapters.

[Chebyshev's Theorem and the Empirical Rules](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

One of the more important results in statistics is

**Chebyshev's theorem**

, which states that for

*any set of data*

, the proportion of values that lie within

*k*

standard deviations

1

*k*

7

of the

mean is at least 1

-

\>

*k*

2

. Thus, for

*k*

=

2, at least 3/4, or 75%, of the data lie within two

standard deviations of the mean; for

*k*

=

3, at least 8/9, or 89%, of the data lie within three

standard deviations of the mean. We can use these values to provide a basic understanding of   
the variation in a set of data using only the computed mean and standard deviation.

EXAMPLE 4.23

Applying Chebyshev's Theorem

For the cost per order data in the

Purchase Orders

database, a two-standard-deviation interval around   
the mean is \[

-

$33,390.34, $85,980.98\]. If we count the

number of observations within this interval, we find that   
89 of 94, or 94.7%, fall within two standard deviations

of the mean. A three-standard-deviation interval is   
\[

-

$63,233.17, $115,823.81\], and we see that 92 of 94, or

97.9%, fall in this interval. Both percentages are above the   
thresholds of 75% and 89% in Chebyshev's theorem.

For many data sets encountered in practice, such as the cost per order data, the per-

centages are generally much higher than what Chebyshev's theorem specifies. These are   
reflected in what are called the

**empirical rules**

:

**1.**

Approximately 68% of the observations will fall within one standard deviation   
of the mean, or between

*x*

-

*s*

and

*x*

+

*s*

.

**2.**

Approximately 95% of the observations will fall within two standard deviations   
of the mean, or within

*x*

{

2

*s*

.

**3.**

Approximately 99.7% of the observations will fall within three standard devia-  
tions of the mean, or within

*x*

{

3

*s*

.

We see that the cost per order data reflect these empirical rules rather closely. Depend-  
ing on the data and the shape of the frequency distribution, the actual percentages may be   
higher or lower.

To illustrate the empirical rules, suppose that a retailer knows that on average, an

order is delivered by standard ground transportation in eight days with a standard deviation   
of one day. With the first empirical rule, about 68% of the observations will fall between   
seven and nine days. Using the second empirical rule, 95% of the observations will fall   
between six and ten days. Finally, using the third rule, almost 100% of the observations   
will fall between 5 and 11 days. These rules can be used to predict future observations,   
assuming that the sample data are representative of the future. Generally, rules 2 and 3 are   
commonly used. Note, however, that using rule 2, there is a 5% chance that an observation   
will fall outside the predicted range. Since the third empirical rule generally covers nearly   
all of the observations, it provides a better prediction and reduces the risk that a future   
observation will fall outside of the predicted range.

As another example, it is important to ensure that the output from a manufacturing

process meets the specifications that engineers and designers require. The dimensions for

Descriptive Statistics

a typical manufactured part are usually specified by a target, or ideal, value as well as a   
tolerance, or "fudge factor," that recognizes that variation will exist in most manufactur-  
ing processes due to factors such as materials, machines, work methods, human perfor-  
mance, and environmental conditions. For example, a part dimension might be specified   
as 5.00

{

0.2 cm. This simply means that a part having a dimension between 4.80 and

5.20 cm will be acceptable; anything outside of this range would be classified as defective.   
To measure how well a manufacturing process can achieve the specifications, we usually   
take a sample of output, measure the dimension, compute the total variation using the third   
empirical rule (that is, estimate the total variation by six standard deviations), and then   
compare the result to the specifications by dividing the specification range by the total   
variation. The result is called the

**process capability index**

Manufacturers use this index to evaluate the quality of their products and determine when   
they need to make improvements in their processes.

and standard deviation are first computed in cells J3 and   
J4 using the Excel AVERAGE and STDEV.S functions (these   
functions work correctly whether the data are arranged in a   
single column or in a matrix form). Using the third empirical   
rule, the total variation is then calculated as the mean plus or   
minus three standard deviations. In cell J14,

C

p

value less than 1.0 is not good;

it means that the variation in the process is wider than the   
specification limits, signifying that some of the parts will not   
meet the specifications. In practice, many manufacturers   
want to have

C

p

values of at least 1.5.

[Figure 4.28](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#171) shows a frequency distribution and

histogram of these data (worksheet

Histogram

in the

Manufacturing Measurements

workbook). Note that

the bin values represent the upper limits of the group-  
ings in the histogram; thus, three observations fell at or   
below 4.8, the lower specification limit. In addition, five   
observations exceeded the upper specification limit of   
5.2. Therefore, 8 of the 200 observations, or 4%, were   
actually defective, and 96% were acceptable. Although   
this doesn't meet the empirical rule exactly, you must   
remember that we are dealing with sample data. Other   
samples from the same process would have different   
characteristics, but overall, the empirical rule provides a   
good estimate of the total variation in the data that we   
can expect from any sample.

A

**standardized value**

, provides a relative measure of the dis-

tance an observation is from the mean, which is independent of the units of measurement.

We subtract the sample mean from the

, and divide the result by the

sample standard devi[ation. In formula (4.12), the numerator represents the distance that](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#171)

*x*

*i*

is from the sample mean; a negative value indicates that

*x*

*i*

lies to the left of the mean, and

a positive value indicates that it lies to the right of the mean. By dividing by the standard   
deviation,

*s*

, we scale the distance from the mean to express it in units of standard devia-

tions. Thus, a

*z*

-score of 1.0 means that the observation is one standard deviation to the

right of the mean; a

*z*

-score of

-

1.5 means that the observation is 1.5 standard deviations

to the left of the mean. Thus, even though two data sets may have different means and   
standard deviations, the same

-score means that the observations have the same relative

distance from their respective means.

observation, $82,875, is 1.90 standard deviations above the   
mean, whereas observation 94 ($68.75) is 0.88 standard   
deviations below the mean. Only two observations are   
more than three standard deviations above the mean. We

The

**coefficient of variation (CV)**

provides a relative measure of the dispersion in data

relative to the mean and is defined as

CV

=

Standard Deviation

Mean

**( 4 . 1 3 )**

Sometimes the coefficient of variation is multiplied by 100 to express it as a percent. This sta-  
tistic is useful when comparing the variability of two or more data sets when their scales differ.

The coefficient of variation provides a relative measure of risk to return. The smaller

the coefficient of variation, the smaller the relative risk is for the return provided. The   
reciprocal of the coefficient of variation, called

**return to risk**

, is often used because it is

easier to interpret. That is, if the objective is to maximize return, a higher return-to-risk   
ratio is often considered better. A related measure in finance is the

*Sharpe ratio*

, which is

the ratio of a fund's excess returns (annualized total returns minus Treasury bill returns) to   
its standard deviation. If several investment opportunities have the same mean but different   
variances, a rational (risk-averse) investor will select the one that has the smallest vari-  
ance.

5

This approach to formalizing risk is the basis for modern portfolio theory, which

seeks to construct minimum-variance portfolios. As

*Fortune*

magazine once observed, "It's

not that risk is always bad. . . . It's just that when you take chances with your money, you   
want to be paid for it."

6

One practical application of the coefficient of variation is in com-

paring stock prices.

EXAMPLE 4.26

Applying the Coefficient of Variation

If examining only the standard deviations in the

Clos-

ing Stock Prices

worksheet, we might conclude that IBM

is more risky than the other stocks. However, the mean   
stock price of IBM is much greater than the other stocks.   
Thus, comparing standard deviations directly provides little   
information. The coefficient of variation provides a more   
[comparable measure. Figure 4.30 shows the calculations of](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#173)

the coefficients of variation for these variables. For IBM, the   
CV is 0.025; for Intel, 0.027; for Cisco, 0.024; for GE, 0.022;   
and for the DJIA, 0.016. We see that the coefficients of   
variation of the stocks are not very different; in fact, Intel is   
just slightly more risky than IBM relative to its average price.   
However, an index fund based on the Dow would be less   
risky than any of the individual stocks.

Histograms of sample data can take on a variety of different shapes.[Figure 4.31](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#174) shows   
the histograms for cost per order and A/P terms that we created for the

*Purchase Orders*

data. The histogram for A/P terms is relatively symmetric, having its modal value in the   
middle and falling away from the center in roughly the same fashion on either side. How-  
ever, the cost per order histogram is asymmetrical, or

*skewed*

; that is, more of the mass is

concentrated on one side, and the distribution of values "tails off" to the other. Those that   
have more mass on the left and tail off to the right, like this example, are called

*positively*

*skewed*

; those that have more mass on the right and tail off to the left are said to be

*nega-*

*tively skewed*

.

**Skewness**

describes the lack of symmetry of data.

The

**coefficient of skewness (CS)**

measures the degree of asymmetry of observations

around the mean. The coefficient of skewness for a population is computed as

CS

**( 4 . 1 4 )**

It can be computed using the Excel function SKEW.P(

*data range*

). For sample data,

the formula is different, but you may calculate it using the Excel function SKEW(

*data*

*range*

). If CS is positive, the distribution of values is positively skewed; if negative, it is

negatively skewed. The closer CS is to zero, the less the degree of skewness. A coefficient   
of skewness greater than 1 or less than

-

1 suggests a high degree of skewness. A value

between 0.5 and 1 or between

-

0.5 and

-

1 represents moderate skewness. Coefficients

between 0.5 and

-

0.5 indicate relative symmetry.

EXAMPLE 4.27

Measuring Skewness

Using the Excel function SKEW in the

Purchase Orders

database, the coefficients of skewness for the cost per   
order and A/P terms data are calculated as

CS

(cost per order)

=

1.66

CS

(A

\>

P terms)

=

0.60

This tells us that the cost per order data are highly

positively skewed, whereas the A/P terms data are more   
symmetric. These are evident from the histograms in   
[Figure 4.31.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#174)

Histograms that have only one "peak" are called

**unimodal**

. (If a histogram has

exactly two peaks, we call it

**bimodal**

. This often signifies a mixture of samples from dif-

ferent populations.) For unimodal histograms that are relatively symmetric, the mode is a   
fairly good estimate of the mean. For example, the mode for the A/P terms data is clearly   
30 months; the mean is 30.638 months. On the other hand, for the cost per order data,

the mode occurs in the group (0, 13,000). The midpoint of the group, $6,500, which can   
be used as a numerical estimate of the mode, is not very close at all to the true mean of   
$26,295.32. The high level of skewness pulls the mean away from the mode.

Comparing measures of location can sometimes reveal information about the shape of

the distribution of observations. For example, if the distribution was perfectly symmetrical   
and unimodal, the mean, median, and mode would all be the same. If it was negatively   
skewed, we would generally find that mean

**Kurtosis**

refers to the peakedness (that is, high, narrow) or flatness (that is, short, flat-

topped) of a histogram. The

**coefficient of kurtosis (CK)**

measures the degree of kurtosis

of a population and is computed as

CK

**( 4 . 1 5 )**

Distributions with values of CK less than 3 are more flat, with a wide degree of disper-  
sion; those with values of CK greater than 3 are more peaked, with less dispersion. Excel   
computes kurtosis differently; the function KURT (

*data range*

) computes "excess kurtosis"

for sample data (Excel does not have a corresponding function for a population), which is   
CK

−▲

3. Thus, to interpret kurtosis values in Excel, distributions with values less than 0

are more flat, while those with values greater than 0 are more peaked.

Skewness and kurtosis can help provide more information to evaluate risk than just

using the standard deviation. For example, both a negatively and positively skewed distribu-  
tion may have the same standard deviation, but clearly if the objective is to achieve a high   
return, the negatively skewed distribution will have higher probabilities of larger returns.   
The higher the kurtosis, the more area the histogram has in the tails rather than in the middle.   
This can indicate a greater potential for extreme and possibly catastrophic outcomes.

When data are summarized in a frequency distribution, we can use the frequencies to com-  
pute the mean and variance. The following formulas provide a way to calculate the mean   
and variance of data expressed as a frequency distribution.

The mean of a population expressed as a frequency distribution may be computed

using the formula

where

*f*

. Essentially, we multiply the frequency by the

value of observation

*i*

, add them up, and divide by the number of observations.

We may use similar formulas to compute the population variance

Calculations of Mean and

Distribution

In some situations, data may already be grouped in a frequency distribution, and we

may not have access to the raw data. This is often the case when extracting information   
from government databases such as the Census Bureau or Bureau of Labor Statistics. In   
these situations, we cannot compute the mean or variance using the standard formulas.

If the data are grouped into

*k*

cells in a frequency distribution, we can use modified

versions of these formulas to estimate the mean and variance by replacing

*x*

*i*

with a rep-

resentative value (such as the midpoint,

*M*

) for all the observations in each cell group and

summing over all groups. The corresponding formulas follow. In these formulas,

*k*

is the

number of groups and

*M*

*i*

is the midpoint of group

*i*

Statistics such as means and variances are not appropriate for categorical data. Instead, we   
are generally interested in the fraction of data that have a certain characteristic. The formal   
statistical measure is called the

It is important to realize that proportions are numbers between 0 and 1. Although we

often convert these to percentages---for example, 12.8% of orders were placed with Space-  
time Technologies in the last example---we must be careful to use the decimal expression

Two variables have a strong statistical relationship with one another if they appear to move   
together. We see many examples on a daily basis; for instance, attendance at baseball   
games is often closely related to the win percentage of the team, and ice cream sales likely   
have a strong relationship with daily temperature. We can examine relationships between   
two vari[ables visually using scatter charts, which we introduced in Chapter 3.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#114)

When two variables appear to be related, you might suspect a cause-and-effect relation-

ship. Sometimes, however, statistical relationships exist even though a change in one   
variable is not

*caused*

by a change in the other. For example, the

*New York Times*

reported a

strong statistical relationship between the golf handicaps of corporate CEOs and their   
companies' stock market performance over three years. CEOs who were better-than-average   
golfers were likely to deliver above-average returns to shareholders.

7

Clearly, the ability to

golf would not cause better business performance. Therefore, you must be cautious in   
drawing inferences about causal relationships based solely on statistical relationships. (On   
the other hand, you might want to spend more time out on the practice range!)

Understanding the relationships between variables is extremely important in making

good business decisions, particularly when cause-and-effect relationships can be justified.   
When a company understands how internal factors such as product quality, employee train-  
ing, and pricing affect such external measures as profitability and customer satisfaction, it   
can make better decisions. Thus, it is helpful to have statistical tools for measuring these   
relationships.

contains data from 49 top liberal arts and research universities across the United States.   
Several questions might be raised about statistical relationships among these variables.   
For instance, does a higher percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school   
class suggest a higher graduation rate? Is acceptance rate related to the amount spent per   
student? Do schools with lower acceptance rates tend to accept students with higher SAT   
scores? Questions such as these can be addressed by computing statistical measures of   
association between the variables.

[Covariance](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

**Covariance**

is a measure of the linear association between two variables,

*X*

and

*Y*

. Like

the variance, different formulas are used for populations and samples. Computationally,   
covariance of a population is the average of the products of deviations of each observation   
from its respective mean:

cov(

*X*

,

*Y*

)

=

**( 4 . 2 5 )**

To better understand the covariance, let us examine[formula (4.25)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#181). The covariance

between

*X*

and

*Y*

is the average of the product of the deviations of each pair of observations

from their respective means. Suppose that large (small) values of

*X*

are generally associ-

ated with large (small) values of

*Y*

. Then, in most cases, both

*x*

*i*

and

*y*

*i*

are either above or

below their respective means. If so, the product of the deviations from the means will be a   
positive number and when added together and averaged will give a positive value for the   
covariance. On the other hand, if small (large) values of

*X*

are associated with large (small)

values of

*Y*

, then one of the deviations from the mean will generally be negative while

the other is positive. When multiplied together, a negative value results, and the value of   
the covariance will be negative. Thus, the larger the absolute value of the covariance, the   
higher the degree of linear association between the two variables. The sign of the covari-  
ance tells us whether there is a direct relationship (that is, one variable increases as the   
other increases) or an inverse relationship (that is, one variable increases while the other   
decreases, or vice versa). We can generally identify the strength of any linear associa-  
tion between two variables and the sign of the covariance by constructing a scatter dia-  
gram. The Excel function COVARIANCE.P(

*array1, array2*

) computes the covariance of

a population.

The numerical value of the covariance is generally difficult to interpret because it depends   
on the units of measurement of the variables. For example, if we expressed the graduation   
rate as a true proportion rather than as a percentage in the previous example, the numeri-  
cal value of the covariance would be smaller, although the linear association between the   
variables would be the same.

and

which does not depend on the units of measurement. Correlation is measured by the

Excel's CORREL(

data arrays.

A correlation of 0 indicates that the two variables have no linear relationship to each

other. Thus, if one changes, we cannot reasonably predict what the other variable might   
do. A positive correlation coefficient indicates a linear relationship when one variable   
increases while the other also increases. A negative correlation coefficient indicates a lin-  
ear relationship when one variable that increases while the other decreases. In economics,   
for instance, a price-elastic product has a negative correlation between price and sales; as   
price increases, sales decrease, and vice versa. Visualizations of correlation are illustrated   
[in Figure 4.42. Note that although Figure 4.42(d) sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#183)ws a clear relationship between the   
variables, the relationship is not linear and the correlation is zero.

Earlier we noted that the mean and range are sensitive to outliers---unusually large or small   
values in the data. Outliers can make a significant difference in the results we obtain from sta-  
tistical analyses. An important statistical question is how to identify them. The first thing to do   
from a practical perspective is to check the data for possible errors, such as a misplaced decimal   
point or an incorrect transcription to a computer file. Histograms can help to identify possible   
outliers visually. We might use the empirical rule and

*z*

-scores to identify an outlier as one that

is more than three standard deviations from the mean. We can also identify outliers based on the   
interquartile range. "Mild" outliers are often defined as being between 1.5 ×

quartiles. Basically, there is no standard definition of what constitutes an outlier other than an   
unusual observation as compared with the rest. However, it is important to try to identify outli-  
ers and determine their significance when conducting business analytic studies.

None of the correlations are very strong. The moderate   
positive correlation between the graduation rate and SAT   
scores indicates that schools with higher median SATs   
have higher graduation rates. We see a moderate negative   
correlation between acceptance rate and graduation rate,

indicating that schools with lower acceptance rates have   
higher graduation rates. We also see that the acceptance   
rate is also negatively correlated with the median SAT and   
top 10% HS, suggesting that schools with lower accep-  
tance rates have higher student profiles. The correlations   
with expenditures/student also suggest that schools with   
higher student profiles spend more money per student.

exhibit outliers, combinations of them might. We see this in   
the scatter diagram in [Figure 4.48.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#186) The last observation has a   
high market value ($120,700) but a relatively small house size

(1,581 square feet). The point on the scatter diagram does   
not seem to coincide with the rest of the data.

The question is what to do with possible outliers.

They should not be blindly eliminated unless there is a   
legitimate reason for doing so---for instance, if the last   
home in the Home Market Value example has an outdoor   
pool that makes it significantly different from the rest of   
the neighborhood. Statisticians often suggest that analy-  
ses should be run with and without the outliers so that the   
results can be compared and examined critically.

The importance of applying statistical concepts to make good business decisions and   
improve performance cannot be overemphasized.

**Statistical thinking**

is a philosophy of

learning and action for improvement that is based on the principles that

■

■

all work occurs in a system of interconnected processes,

■

■

variation exists in all processes, and

■

■

better performance results from understanding and reducing variation.

8

Work gets done in any organization through

*processes*

---systematic ways of doing

things that achieve desired results. Understanding business processes provides the   
context for determining the effects of variation and the proper type of action to be   
taken. Any process contains many sources of variation. In manufacturing, for example,   
different batches of material vary in strength, thickness, or moisture content. During   
manufacturing, tools experience wear, vibrations cause changes in machine settings,   
and electrical fluctuations cause variations in power. Workers may not position parts   
on fixtures consistently, and physical and emotional stress may affect workers' consis-  
tency. In addition, measurement gauges and human inspection capabilities are not uni-  
form, resulting in measurement error. Similar phenomena occur in service processes   
because of variation in employee and customer behavior, application of technology,   
and so on. Reducing variation results in more consistency in manufacturing and ser-  
vice processes, fewer errors, happier customers, and better accuracy of such things as   
delivery time quotes.

Although variation exists everywhere, many managers often do not recognize it or

consider it in their decisions. How often do managers make decisions based on one or two   
data points without looking at the pattern of variation, see trends in data that aren't justi-  
fied, or try to manipulate measures they cannot truly control? Unfortunately, the answer is   
quite often. For example, if sales in some region fell from the previous quarter, a regional   
manager might quickly blame her sales staff for not working hard enough, even though the   
drop in sales may simply be the result of uncontrollable variation. Usually, it is simply a   
matter of ignorance of how to deal with variation in data. This is where business analytics   
can play a significant role. Statistical analysis can provide better insight into the facts and   
nature of relationships among the many factors that may have contributed to an event and   
enable managers to make better decisions.

Sur-

gery Infections

that document the number of infections that

occurred after surgeries over 36 months at one hospital, along   
with a line chart of the number of infections. (We will assume   
that the number of surgeries performed each month was the   
same.) The number of infections tripled in months 2 and 3   
as compared to the first month. Is this indicative of a trend   
caused by failure of some health care protocol or simply ran-  
dom variation? Should action be taken to determine a cause?   
From a statistical perspective, three points are insufficient to   
conclude that a trend exists. It is more appropriate to look at a   
larger sample of data and study the pattern of variation.

Over the 36 months, the data clearly indicate that

variation exists in the monthly infection rates. The number   
of infections seems to fluctuate between 0 and 3 with the   
exception of month 12. However, a visual analysis of the   
chart cannot necessarily lead to a valid conclusion. So   
let's apply some statistical thinking. The average number   
of infections is 1.583, and the standard deviation is 1.180.

If we apply the empirical rule that most observations   
should fall within three standard deviations of the mean,   
we would expect them to fall between

-

1.957 (clearly, the

number of infections cannot be negative, so let's set this   
value to zero) and 5.124. This means that, from a statisti-  
cal perspective, we can expect almost all the observations   
[to fall within these limits. Figure 4.51 shows the chart dis-](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#190)playing these ranges. The number of infections for month   
12 clearly exceeds the upper range value and suggests   
that the number of infections for this month is statistically   
different from the rest. The hospital administrator should   
seek to investigate what may have happened that month   
and try to prevent similar occurrences.

Similar analyses are used routinely in quality control

and other business applications to monitor performance   
statistically. The proper analytical calculations depend on   
the type of measure and other factors and are explained   
fully in books dedicated to quality control and quality   
management.

Because we usually deal with sample data in business analytics applications, it is extremely   
important to understand that different samples from any population will vary; that is, they   
will have different means, standard deviations, and other statistical measures and will have   
differences in the shapes of histograms. In particular, samples are extremely sensitive to   
the sample size---the number of observations included in the samples.

Over the past decade, there have been numerous discov-  
eries of management fraud that have led to the downfall   
of several prominent companies. These companies had   
been effective in hiding their financial difficulties, and   
investors and creditors are now seeking ways to identify   
financial problems before scandals occur. Even with the   
passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in July 2002, which   
helped to improve the quality of the data being disclosed   
to the public, it is still possible to misjudge an organiza-  
tion's financial strength without analytical evaluation. Sev-  
eral warning signs exist, but there is no systematic and   
objective way to determine whether a given financial met-  
ric, such as a write-off or insider-trading pattern, is high   
or unusual.

Based on Deniz Senturk, Christina LaComb, Radu Neagu, and Murat Doganaksoy, "Detect Financial

Problems With Six Sigma,"

*Quality Progress*

(April 2006): 41--47.

Researchers have proposed using statistical thinking

to detect anomalies. They propose an "anomaly detection   
score," which is the difference between a target financial   
measure and the company's own past performance or its   
competitors' current performance using standard devia-  
tions. This technique is a variation of a standardized

z

-score.

Specifically, their approach involves comparing perfor-  
mance to past performance (within analysis) and comparing   
performance to the performance of the company's peers   
over the same period (between analyses). They created   
two types of exceptional anomaly scores:

z

-between (

Z

)

to address the variation between companies and

z

(

) to address the variation within the company. These

measures quantify the number of standard deviations a

company's financial measure deviates from the average.   
Using these measures, the researchers applied the tech-  
nique to 25 case studies. These included several high-  
profile companies that had been charged with financial   
statement fraud by the SEC or had admitted account-  
ing errors, causing a restatement of their financials. The   
method was able to identify anomalies for critical metrics   
known by experts to be warning signs for financial state-  
ment fraud. These warning signs were consistent when   
compared with expert postmortem commentary on the   
high-profile fraud cases. More importantly, they signaled   
anomalous behavior at least six quarters before an SEC   
investigation announcement with fewer than 5% false   
negatives and 40% false positives.

using the following scale:

0---Did not meet expectations

1---Marginally met expectations

2---Met expectations

3---Exceeded expectations

4---Greatly exceeded expectations

The questions are as follows:

Q1:

Did the support representative explain the   
process for resolving your problem?

Q2:

Did the support representative keep you in-  
formed about the status of progress in resolv-  
ing your problem?

Q3:

Was the support representative courteous and   
professional?

Q4:

Was your problem resolved?

Q5:

Was your problem resolved in an acceptable   
amount of time?

Q6:

Overall, how did you find the service provided   
by our technical support department?

A final question asks the customer to rate the overall

quality of the product using a scale: 0---very poor,   
1---poor, 2---good, 3---very good, 4---excellent. A   
sample of survey responses and associated resolution   
and response data are provided in the Excel file

In the manufacturing process,

sterile liquid drug is poured into glass syringes and

is tacked at a shorter-than-desired length (less than   
4.920 inches) leads to pressure on the cartridge stop-  
per and, hence, partial or complete activation of the   
syringe. Such syringes must then be scrapped. If the   
cap is tacked at a longer-than-desired length (4.980   
inches or longer), the tacking is incomplete or inade-  
quate, which can lead to cap loss and a potential car-  
tridge loss in shipment and handling. Such syringes   
can be reworked manually to attach the cap at a lower   
position. However, this process requires a 100%   
inspection of the tacked syringes and results in   
increased cost for the items. This final production step   
seemed to be producing more and more scrap and   
reworked syringes over successive weeks.

Chapter 5

Probability Distributions and Data Modeling

Most business decisions involve some elements of uncertainty and random-

ness. For example, the times to repair computers in the

Computer Repair Times

Excel file [that we discussed in Chapter 4 show](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144)ed quite a bit of uncertainty that

we needed to understand to provide information to customers about their com-

puter repairs. We also saw that different samples of repair times result in different

means, variances, and frequency distributions. Therefore, it would be beneficial

to be able to identify some general characteristics of repair times that would

apply to the entire population---even those repairs that have not yet taken place.

In other situations, we may not have any data for analysis and simply need to

make some judgmental assumptions about future uncertainties. For example,

to develop a model to predict the profitability of a new and innovative product,

we would need to make reliable assumptions about sales and consumer behav-

ior without any prior data on which to base them. Characterizing the nature of

distributions of data and specifying uncertain assumptions in decision models

relies on fundamental knowledge of probability concepts and probability distribu-

tions---the subject of this chapter.

Understanding probability and probability distributions is important in all

areas of business. For example, marketing analysts who wish to predict future

sales might use probability to assess the likelihood that consumers will pur-

chase their products. In finance, probability is useful in assessing risk of capital

investments or product development initiatives. Operations managers apply it

routinely in quality control, inventory management, design for product reliabil-

ity, and customer service policies. Company executives use probability to make

competitive decisions and analyze long-term strategies. Coaches and manag-

ers of sports teams use probability to make tactical decisions, such as the best

football play to make when faced with third down and 4 yards to go on the

opponent's 17-yard line. You use probability concepts in daily life more than

you probably realize, such as when deciding whether or not to play golf or go

to the beach based on the weather forecast. To experience using probability to

make decisions in a game setting, check out one of the author's favorite games,

[Basic Concepts of Probability](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

The notion of probability is used everywhere, both in business and in our daily lives, from   
market research and stock market predictions to the World Series of Poker and weather   
forecasts. In business, managers need to know such things as the likelihood that a new   
product will be profitable or the chances that a project will be completed on time. Probabil-  
ity quantifies the uncertainty that we encounter all around us and is an important building   
block for business analytics applications.

**Probability**

is the likelihood that an outcome---

such as whether a new product will be profitable or not or whether a project will be com-  
pleted within 15 weeks---occurs. Probabilities are expressed as values between 0 and 1,   
although many people convert them to percentages. The statement that there is a 10%   
chance that oil prices will rise next quarter is another way of stating that the probability   
of a rise in oil prices is 0.1. The closer the probability is to 1, the more likely it is that the   
outcome will occur.

[Experiments and Sample Spaces](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

To formally discuss probability, we need some new terminology. An

**experiment**

is a pro-

cess that results in an outcome. An experiment might be as simple as rolling two dice,   
observing and recording weather conditions, conducting a market research study, or watch-  
ing the stock market. The

**outcome**

of an experiment is a result that we observe; it might be

the sum of two dice, a description of the weather, the proportion of consumers who favor   
a new product, or the change in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) at the end of a   
week. The collection of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the

**sample space**

.

For instance, if we roll two fair dice, the possible outcomes for the sum are the numbers   
2 through 12; if we observe the weather, the outcome might be clear, partly cloudy, or   
cloudy; the outcomes for customer reaction to a new product in a market research study   
would be favorable or unfavorable, and the weekly change in the DJIA can theoretically   
be any real number (positive, negative, or zero). Note that a sample space may consist of a   
small number of discrete outcomes or an infinite number of outcomes.

Enumerating and counting the outcomes for an experiment can sometimes be difficult,   
particularly when the experiment consists of multiple steps. A bit of logic and visualization   
often helps.

Rolling Two Dice

Suppose we roll two dice. The first roll can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,   
or 6. For each of these outcomes, the second roll can also   
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Thus, the outcomes of the experiment   
are (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), . . . , (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6). We can visu-

Selecting

Objects from

In a group of five students, an instructor might wish to select   
three of them to make presentations. How many different   
ways can this be done? Note that the same student cannot   
be selected more than once. You might use the analogy of   
drawing three cards from a deck of five without replacing

the cards that are drawn. The first student selected can be   
student 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, if student 1 is selected   
first, then the second student can be 2, 3, 4, or 5. Then, if   
the second student selected is student 4, the third student   
can be 2, 3, or 5. (Try to draw a tree diagram for this!)

In some experiments, we want to select

objects from a set of

objects.

However, many of these are duplicates, for instance, (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1),   
(3, 1, 2), and (3, 2, 1). Since the order does not matter, we only want to count unique out-

the order is important (for instance, knowing which student   
[presents first, second, and third). Applying formula (5.3), we](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#206)have

The permutations formula is easier to apply because we   
don't have to think of how many outcomes can occur in   
each step of the process, particularly when the number of   
steps is large.

Probability may be defined from one of three perspectives. First, if the process that   
generates the outcomes is known, probabilities can be deduced from theoretical argu-  
ments; this is the

Chapter 5

Probability Distributions and Data Modeling

The second approach to probability, called the

*relative frequency definition*

, is based

on empirical data. The probability that an outcome will occur is simply the relative   
frequency associated with that outcome.

Finally, the

*subjective definition*

of probability is based on judgment and experience,

as financial analysts might use in predicting a 75% chance that the DJIA will increase 10%   
over the next year, or as sports experts might predict at the start of the football season, a   
1-in-5 chance (0.20 probability) of a certain team making it to the Super Bowl.

Which definition to use depends on the specific application and the information we

have available. We will see various examples that draw upon each of these perspectives.

EXAMPLE 5.6

Relative Frequency Definition of Probability

Using the sample of computer repair times in the Excel   
file

Computer Repair Times

, we developed the relative fre-

[quency distribution in Chapter 4, shown again in Figure 5.2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144)We could state that the probability that a computer would   
be repaired in as little as four days is 0, the probability that

it would be repaired in exactly ten days is 0.076, and so   
on. In using the relative frequency definition, it is important   
to understand that as more data become available, the   
distribution of outcomes and, hence, the probabilities may   
change.

EXAMPLE 5.5

Classical Definition of Probability

Suppose we roll two dice. If we examine the outcomes   
[described in Example 5.1 and add the values of the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#205)dice, we may find the probabilities of rolling each value   
between 2 and 12. The probability of rolling any number   
is the ratio of the number of ways of rolling that number   
to the total number of possible outcomes. For instance,   
the probability of rolling a 2 is 1

\>

36, the probability of roll-

ing a 3 is 2

\>

36

=

1

\>

18

,

and the probability of rolling a 7 is

6

\>

36

=

1

\>

6. Similarly, if two consumers are asked whether

or not they like a new product, there could be four possible   
outcomes:

1.

(like, like)

2.

(like, dislike)

3.

(dislike, like)

4.

(dislike, dislike)

If these are assumed to be equally likely, the probability that

at least

one consumer would respond unfavorably is

3

\>

4

.

An

**event**

is a collection of one or more outcomes from a sample space. Examples of events

are rolling a sum of 7 or 11 with two dice, completing a computer repair in between 7 and 14   
days, and obtaining a positive weekly change in the DJIA. This leads to the following rule:

**Rule 1.**

The probability of any event is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes that

comprise that event.

If

*A*

is any event, the

**complement**

of

*A*

, denoted

*A*

*c*

, consists of all outcomes in the

sample space not in

*A*

.

**Rule 2.**

The probability of the complement of any event

*A*

is

*P*

1

*A*

*c*

2

=

1

-

*P*

1

*A*

2

.

The

**union**

of two events contains all outcomes that belong to either of the two events.

To illustrate this with rolling the sum of dice, let

*A*

be the event {7, 11} and

*B*

be the event

{2, 3, 12}. The union of

*A*

and

*B*

is the event {2, 3, 7, 11, 12}. If

*A*

and

*B*

are two events,

the probability that some outcome in either

*A*

or

*B*

(that is, the union of

*A*

and

*B*

) occurs is

denoted as

*P*

(

*A*

or

*B*

). Finding this probability depends on whether the events are mutually

exclusive or not.

Two events are

**mutually exclusive**

if they have no outcomes in common. The events

*A*

and

*B*

in the dice example are mutually exclusive. When events are mutually exclusive,

the following rule applies:

**Rule 3.**

If events

*A*

and

*B*

are mutually exclusive, then

*P*

1

*A*

or

*B*

2

=

*P*

1

*A*

2

+

*P*

1

*B*

2

.

EXAMPLE 5.7

Computing the Probability of an Event

Consider the event of rolling a 7 or 11 on two dice. The pro-  
bability of rolling a 7 is

6

36

and the probability of rolling an 11

is

2

36

; thus, the probability of rolling a 7 or 11 is

6

36

Chapter 5

Probability Distributions and Data Modeling

If two events are

*not*

mutually exclusive, then adding their probabilities would result

in double-counting some outcomes, so an adjustment is necessary. This leads to the fol-  
lowing rule:

**Rule 4.**

If two events

*A*

and

*B*

are not mutually exclusive, then

*P*

1

*A*

or

*B*

2

=

*P*

1

*A*

2

+

*P*

1

*B*

2

-

*P*

1

*A*

and

*B*

2

.

Here, (

*A*

and

*B*

) represents the

**intersection**

of events

*A*

and

*B*

---that is, all outcomes

belonging to both

*A*

and

*B*

.

[Joint and Marginal Probability](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

In many applications, more than one event occurs simultaneously, or in statistical terminol-  
ogy,

*jointly*

. We will only discuss the simple case of two events. For instance, suppose that

a sample of 100 individuals were asked to evaluate their preference for three new proposed   
energy drinks in a blind taste test. The sample space consists of two types of outcomes   
corresponding to each individual: gender (

*F*

=

female or

*M*

=

male) and brand prefer-

ence (

*B*

1

,

*B*

2

, or

*B*

3

). We may define a new sample space consisting of the outcomes that

reflect the different combinations of outcomes from these two sample spaces. Thus, for   
any respondent in the blind taste test, we have six possible (mutually exclusive) combina-  
tions of outcomes:

**1.**

*O*

1

=

the respondent is female and prefers brand 1

**2.**

*O*

2

=

the respondent is female and prefers brand 2

**3.**

*O*

3

=

the respondent is female and prefers brand 3

**4.**

*O*

4

=

the respondent is male and prefers brand 1

**5.**

*O*

5

=

the respondent is male and prefers brand 2

**6.**

*O*

6

=

the respondent is male and prefers brand 3

Here, the probability of each of these events is the intersection of the gender and brand   
preference event. For example,

*P*

1

*O*

1

2

=

*P*

1

*F*

and

*B*

1

2

,

*P*

1

*O*

2

2

=

*P*

1

*F*

and

*B*

2

2

, and so

on. The probability of the intersection of two events is called a

**joint probability**

. The

probability of an event, irrespective of the outcome of the other joint event, is called a

**marginal probability**

. Thus,

*P*

1

*F*

2

,

*P*

1

*M*

2

,

*P*

1

*B*

1

2

,

*P*

1

*B*

2

2

, and

*P*

1

*B*

3

2

would be marginal

probabilities.

EXAMPLE 5.9

Computing the Probability of Mutually Exclusive Events

For the dice example, the probability of event

A

=

5

7, 11

6

is

P

A

2

=

8

36

, and the probability of event

B

=

5

2, 3, 12

6

is

P

1

B

2

=

4

36

. Therefore, the probability that either event

A

or

B

occurs, that is, the sum of the dice is 2, 3, 7, 11, or 12, is

36

+

. Then

A

Table. The joint probabilities of gender and brand preference   
are easily calculated by dividing the number of respondents   
corresponding to each of the six outcomes listed above

O

that the sum of the probabilities of all these outcomes is 1.

We see that the event

composed of the outcomes

Events

are mutually exclusive, as are events

B

,

, and

, since a respondent may be only male or

We can use rule 3 to find, for example,

**Conditional probability**

is the probability of occurrence of one event

*A*

, given that another

event

*B*

is known to be true or has already occurred.

Conditional probabilities are useful in analyzing data in cross-tabulations, as well as

in other types of applications. Many companies save purchase histories of customers to   
predict future sales. Conditional probabilities can help to predict future purchases based   
on past purchases.

EXAMPLE 5.12

Computing a Conditional Probability in a Cross-Tabulation

We will use the information shown in the energy drink survey   
example in[Figure 5.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#210) to illustrate how to compute conditional   
probabilities from a cross-tabulation or joint probability table.

Suppose that we know that a respondent is male. What

is the probability that he prefers brand 1? From the Pivot-  
Table, note that there are only 63 males in the group and

of these, 25 prefer brand 1. Therefore, the probability that   
a male respondent prefers brand 1 is

25  
63

. We could have

obtained the same result from the joint probability table by   
dividing the joint probability 0.25 (the probability that the   
respondent is male and prefers brand 1) by the marginal   
probability 0.63 (the probability that the respondent is male).

EXAMPLE 5.13

Conditional Probability in Marketing

The Excel file

Apple Purchase History

presents a hypo-

thetical history of consumer purchases of Apple products,   
showing the first and second purchase for a sample of   
200 customers who have made repeat purchases (see   
[Figure 5.4). The PivotTable in Figure 5.5 shows the count](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#211)of the type of second purchase given that each product   
was purchased first. For example, 13 customers purchased   
iMacs as their first Apple product. Then the conditional

probability of purchasing an iPad given that the customer   
first purchased an iMac is

2

13

=

0.15. Similarly, 74 custom-

ers purchased a MacBook as their first purchase; the con-  
ditional probability of purchasing an iPhone if a customer   
first purchased a MacBook is

26  
74

=

0.35. By understanding

which products are more likely to be purchased by custom-  
ers who already own other products, companies can better   
target advertising strategies.

Knowing that there is a difference in preference by gender   
can help focus advertising. For example, we see that about   
40% of males prefer brand 1, whereas only about 24% of   
females do, and a higher proportion of females prefer brand   
3. This suggests that it would make more sense to focus on   
advertising brand 1 more in male-oriented media and brand   
3 in female-oriented media.

Using the Multiplication Law of Probability

Texas Holdem has become a popular game because   
of the publicity surrounding the World Series of Poker.   
At the beginning of a game, players each receive two   
cards face down (we won't worry about how the rest   
of the game is played). Suppose that a player receives   
an ace on her first card. The probability that she will   
end up with "pocket aces" (two aces in the hand)

[Random Variables and Probability Distributions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

Some experiments naturally have numerical outcomes, such as a sum of dice, the time it   
takes to repair computers, or the weekly change in a stock market index. For other experi-  
ments, such as obtaining consumer response to a new product, the sample space is cat-  
egorical. To have a consistent mathematical basis for dealing with probability, we would   
like the outcomes of all experiments to be numerical. A

**random variable**

is a numerical

description of the outcome of an experiment. Formally, a random variable is a function that   
assigns a real number to each element of a sample space. If we have categorical outcomes,   
we can associate an arbitrary numerical value to them. For example, if a consumer likes a   
product in a market research study, we might assign this outcome a value of 1; if the con-  
sumer dislikes the product, we might assign this outcome a value of 0. Random variables   
are usually denoted by capital italic letters, such as

*X*

or

*Y*

.

Random variables may be discrete or continuous. A

**discrete random variable**

is

one for which the number of possible outcomes can be counted. A

**continuous random**

**variable**

has outcomes over one or more continuous intervals of real numbers.

A

**probability distribution**

is the characterization of the possible values that a ran-

dom variable may assume along with the probability of assuming these values. A probabil-  
ity distribution can be either discrete or continuous, depending on the nature of the random   
variable it models. Discrete distributions are easier to understand and work with, and we   
deal with them first.

We may develop a probability distribution using any one of the three perspectives of

probability. First, if we can quantify the probabilities associated with the values of a random   
variable from theoretical arguments, then we can easily define the probability distribution.

Second, we can calculate the relative frequencies from a sample of empirical data to

develop a probability distribution. Thus, the relative frequency distribution of computer   
[repair times (Figure 5.2) is an e](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#207)xample. Because this is based on sample data, we usually   
call this an

**empirical probability distribution**

. An empirical probability distribution is an

approximation of the probability distribution of the associated random variable, whereas   
the probability distribution of a random variable, such as the one derived from counting   
arguments, is a theoretical model of the random variable.

EXAMPLE 5.18

Discrete and Continuous Random Variables

The outcomes of the sum of rolling two dice (the numbers   
2 through 12) and customer reactions to a product (like   
or dislike) are discrete random variables. The number of   
outcomes may be finite or theoretically infinite, such as   
the number of hits on a Web site link during some period   
of time---we cannot place a guaranteed upper limit on this

number; nevertheless, the number of hits can be counted.   
Examples of continuous random variables are the weekly   
change in the DJIA, the daily temperature, the time to com-  
plete a task, the time between failures of a machine, and   
the return on an investment.

EXAMPLE 5.19

Probability Distribution of Dice Rolls

The probabilities of the sum of outcomes for rolling two   
dice are calculated by counting the number of ways to   
roll each sum divided by the total number of possible

outcomes. These, along with an Excel column chart depict-  
ing the probability distribution, are shown from the Excel file

Chapter 5

Probability Distributions and Data Modeling

Finally, we could simply specify a probability distribution using subjective values and

expert judgment. This is often done in creating decision models for phenomena for which   
we have no historical data.

Researchers have identified many common types of probability distributions that are

useful in a variety of applications of business analytics. A working knowledge of common   
families of probability distributions is important for several reasons. First, it can help you   
to understand the underlying process that generates sample data. We investigate the rela-  
tionship between distributions and samples later. Second, many phenomena in business   
and nature follow some theoretical distribution and, therefore, are useful in building deci-  
sion models. Finally, working with distributions is essential in computing probabilities of   
occurrence of outcomes to assess risk and make decisions.

in the next year. This might have been created purely by

intuition and expert judgment, but we hope it would be sup-

using business analytics tools.

in the

Dice Rolls

Excel file. To use this, suppose we want to

know the probability of rolling a 6 or less. We simply look   
up the cumulative probability for 6, which is 0.4167. Alter-  
natively, we could locate the point for

x

=

6 in the chart

and estimate the probability from the graph. Also note that   
since the probability of rolling a 6 or less is 0.4167, then the   
probability of the complementary event (rolling a 7 or more)   
is 1

-

0.4167

=

0.5833. We can also use the cumulative

distribution function to find probabilities over intervals. For   
example, to find the probability of rolling a number between

EXAMPLE 5.24

Expected Value on Television

One of the author's favorite examples stemmed from a task   
in season 1 of the former TV show,

The Apprentice

. Teams

were required to select an artist and sell his or her art for   
the highest total amount of money. One team selected a   
mainstream artist who specialized in abstract art that sold   
for between $1,000 and $2,000; the second team chose   
an avant-garde artist whose surrealist and rather contro-  
versial art was priced much higher. Guess who won? The   
first team did, because the probability of selling a piece of   
mainstream art was much higher than the avant-garde art-  
ist whose bizarre art (the team members themselves didn't   
even like it!) had a very low probability of a sale. A simple   
expected value calculation would have easily predicted the   
winner.

A popular game show that took TV audiences by

storm several years ago was called

Deal or No Deal

. The

game involved a set of numbered briefcases that contain   
amounts of money from 1 cent to $1,000,000. Contestants   
begin choosing cases to be opened and removed, and their   
amounts are shown. After each set of cases is opened,

the banker offers the contestant an amount of money to   
quit the game, which the contestant may either choose or   
reject. Early in the game, the banker's offers are usually   
less than the expected value of the remaining cases, pro-  
viding an incentive to continue. However, as the number   
of remaining cases becomes small, the banker's offers   
approach or may even exceed the average of the remain-  
ing cases. Most people press on until the bitter end and   
often walk away with a smaller amount than they could   
have had they been able to estimate the expected value of   
the remaining cases and make a more rational decision. In   
one case, a contestant had five briefcases left with $100,   
$400, $1,000, $50,000, and $300,000. Because the choice   
of each case is equally likely, the expected value was   
0.2

she said "No deal" and proceeded to open the $300,000   
suitcase, eliminating it from the game. She took the next   
banker's offer of $21,000, which was more than 60% larger   
than the expected value of the remaining cases.

It is important to understand that the expected value is a "long-run average" and is

appropriate for decisions that occur on a repeated basis. For one-time decisions, however,   
you need to consider the downside risk and the upside potential of the decision. The fol-  
lowing example illustrates this.

Chapter 5

Probability Distributions and Data Modeling

Decisions based on expected values are common in real estate development, day trad-

ing, and pharmaceutical research projects. Drug development is a good example. The cost   
of research and development projects in the pharmaceutical industry is generally in the   
hundreds of millions of dollars and often approaches $1 billion. Many projects never make   
it to clinical trials or might not get approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Statis-  
tics indicate that 7 of 10 products fail to return the cost of the company's capital. However,   
large firms can absorb such losses because the return from one or two blockbuster drugs   
can easily offset these losses. On an average basis, drug companies make a net profit from   
these decisions.

Expected Value of a Charitable Raffle

Suppose that you are offered the chance to buy one   
of 1,000 tickets sold in a charity raffle for $50, with the   
prize being $25,000. Clearly, the probability of winning   
is

repeatedly over the long run, you would lose an average of   
$25.00

each time

you play. Of course, for any

one

game,

you would either lose $50 or win $24,950. So the question   
becomes, Is the risk of losing $50 worth the potential of win-  
ning $24,950? Although the expected value is negative, you   
might take the chance because the upside potential is large   
relative to what you might lose, and, after all, it is for charity.   
However, if your potential loss is large, you might not take   
the chance, even if the expected value were positive.

EXAMPLE 5.26

Airline Revenue Management

Let us consider a simplified version of the typical revenue   
management process that airlines use. At any date prior   
to a scheduled flight, airlines must make a decision as   
to whether to reduce ticket prices to stimulate demand   
for unfilled seats. If the airline does not discount the fare,   
empty seats might not be sold and the airline will lose rev-  
enue. If the airline discounts the remaining seats too early

(and could have sold them at the higher fare), they will   
lose profit. The decision depends on the probability

p

of

selling a full-fare ticket if they choose not to discount the   
price. Because an airline makes hundreds or thousands of   
such decisions each day, the expected value approach is   
appropriate.

Similar to our discussion in [Chapter 4,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144) the variance measures the uncertainty of

the random variable; the higher the variance, the higher the uncertainty of the outcome.   
Although variances are easier to work with mathematically, we usually measure the vari-  
ability of a random variable by its standard deviation, which is simply the square root of   
the variance.

[Bernoulli Distribution](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

Assume that only two fares are available: full and dis-

count. Suppose that a full-fare ticket is $560, the discount   
fare is $400, and

p

=

0.75. For simplification, assume that

if the price is reduced, then any remaining seats would be   
sold at that price. The expected value of not discounting the   
price is 0.25(0)

+

0.75(

$

560)

=

$

420. Because this is higher

than the discounted price, the airline should not discount at   
this time. In reality, airlines constantly update the probabil-  
ity

p

based on the information they collect and analyze in a

database. When the value of

p

drops below the break-even

point:

$

400

=

p

$

560

, or

p

=

0.714, then it is beneficial

to discount. It can also work in reverse; if demand is such   
that the probability that a higher-fare ticket would be sold,   
then the price may be adjusted upward. This is why pub-  
lished fares constantly change and why you may receive   
last-minute discount offers or may pay higher prices if you   
wait too long to book a reservation. Other industries such as   
hotels and cruise lines use similar decision strategies.

computer just off the assembly line, we might define a success as "does not boot up" in   
defining a Bernoulli random variable to characterize the probability distribution of a defec-

customers, each of which has a probability

0.2 of making a purchase. Then the prob-

ability distribution of the number of positive responses obtained from ten customers is   
binomial. Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability that exactly

*x*

customers out of the ten will make a purchase for any value of

*x*

between 0 and 10, inclu-

sive. A binomial distribution might also be used to model the results of sampling inspec-

EXAMPLE 5.28

Using the Bernoulli Distribution

A Bernoulli distribution might be used to model whether an   
individual responds positively (

x

=

1) or negatively (

x

=

0)

to a telemarketing promotion. For example, if you estimate   
that 20% of customers contacted will make a purchase,   
the probability distribution that describes whether or not   
a particular individual makes a purchase is Bernoulli with

p

=

0.2. Think of the following experiment. Suppose that

you have a box with 100 marbles, 20 red and 80 white. For   
each customer, select one marble at random (and then   
replace it). The outcome will have a Bernoulli distribution. If a   
red marble is chosen, then that customer makes a purchase;   
if it is white, the customer does not make a purchase.

Priceline is well known for allowing customers to name   
their own prices (but not the service providers) in bidding   
for services such as airline flights or hotel stays. Some   
hotels take advantage of Priceline's approach to fill empty   
rooms for leisure travelers while not diluting the business   
market by offering discount rates through traditional chan-  
nels. In one study using business analytics to develop a   
model to optimize pricing strategies for Kimpton Hotels,   
which develops, owns, or manages more than 40 inde-  
pendent boutique lifestyle hotels in the United States and   
Canada, the distribution of the number of bids for a given   
number of days before arrival was modeled as a Poisson   
distribution because it corresponded well with data that   
were observed. For example, the average number of bids   
placed per day three days before arrival on a weekend   
(the random variable

X

) was 6.3. Therefore, the distribu-

tion used in the model was

As we noted earlier, a continuous random variable is defined over one or more intervals of   
real numbers and, therefore, has an infinite number of possible outcomes. Suppose that the   
expert who predicted the probabilities associated with next year's change in the DJIA in   
[Figure 5.7 k](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#215)ept refining the estimates over larger and larger ranges of v[alues. Figure 5.14](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#225)shows what such a probability distribution might look like using 2.5% increments rather   
than 5%. Notice that the distribution is simil[ar in shape to the one in Figure 5.7 b](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#215)ut sim-  
ply has more outcomes. If this refinement process continues, then the distribution will   
approach the shape of a smooth curve, as shown in the figure. Such a curve that character-  
izes outcomes of a continuous random variable is called a

**probability density function**

and is described by a mathematical function

*f*

(

*x*

).

[Properties of Probability Density Functions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

A probability density function has the following properties:

**1.**

*f*

0

*for all values of x.*

This means that a graph of the density function

must lie at or above the

-axis.

**2.**

*The total area under the density function above the x-axis is 1.*

This is analogous

to the property that the sum of all probabilities of a discrete random variable   
must add to 1.

cal sense to attempt to define a probability for a specific value of

because

there are an infinite number of values.

**4.**

*Probabilities of continuous random variables are only defined over inter-

The cumulative distribution function for a continuous random variable is denoted the

(

), and represents the probability that the ran-

*X*

is less than or equal to

*P*

*x*

2

. Intuitively,

(

*x*

) represents the area

under the density function to the left of

*x. F*

(

*x*

) can often be derived mathematically from

*f*

(

*x*

).

Knowing

*F*

(

*x*

) makes it easy to compute probabilities over intervals for continuous

distributions. The probability that

*X*

is between

*a*

and

*b*

is equal to the difference of the

cumulative distribution function evaluated at these two points; that is,

The formal definitions of expected value and variance for a continuous random vari-

able are similar to those for a discrete random variable; however, to understand them, we   
must rely on notions of calculus, so we do not discuss them in this book. We simply state   
them when appropriate.

[Uniform Distribution](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

The

**uniform distribution**

characterizes a continuous random variable for which all out-

comes between some minimum and maximum value are equally likely. The uniform dis-  
tribution is often assumed in business analytics applications when little is known about a   
random variable other than reasonable estimates for minimum and maximum values. The   
parameters

*a*

and

*b*

are chosen judgmentally to reflect a modeler's best guess about the

range of the random variable.

For a uniform distribution with a minimum value

Although Excel does not provide a function to compute uniform probabilities, the formulas   
are simple enough to incorporate into a spreadsheet. Probabilities are also easy to compute   
for the uniform distribution because of the simple geometric shape of the density function,   
[as Example 5.33 illustrates.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#227)

. An example of a discrete uniform distribution is the roll of a single die.

Each of the numbers 1 through 6 has a

function is 1, which you can easily verify by multiplying the   
height by the width of the rectangle.

Suppose we wish to find the probability that sales

revenue will be less than

two ways. First, compute the area under the density func-  
tion using geometry, as shown in[Figure 5.16.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#227) The area is

[Normal Distribution](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#10)

The

**normal distribution**

is a continuous distribution that is described by the familiar bell-

shaped curve and is perhaps the most important distribution used in statistics. The normal   
distribution is observed in many natural phenomena. Test scores such as the SAT, devia-  
tions from specifications of machined items, human height and weight, and many other   
measurements are often normally distributed.

The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean,

m

, and the stan-

dard deviation,

s

. Thus, as

m

changes, the location of the distribution on the

*x*

-axis also

changes, and as

s

is decreased or increased, the distribution becomes narrower or wider,

respectively[. Figure 5.18 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#228)ws some examples.

The normal distribution has the following properties:

**1.**

The distribution is symmetric, so its measure of skewness is zero.

**2.**

The mean, median, and mode are all equal. Thus, half the area falls above the   
mean and half falls below it.

**3.**

The range of

*X*

is unbounded, meaning that the tails of the distribution extend to

negative and positive infinity.

**4.**

The empirical rules apply exactly for the normal distribution; the area under   
the density function within

{

1 standard deviation is 68.3%, the area under the

density function within

{

2 standard deviations is 95.4%, and the area under

the density function within

{

3 standard deviations is 99.7%.

Normal probabilities cannot be computed using a mathematical formula. Instead,

we may use the Excel function NORM.DIST(

*x*

,

*mean*

,

*standard_deviation*

,

*cumulative*

).

NORM.DIST(

*x*

,

*mean*

,

*standard_deviation*

,

*TRUE*

) calculates the cumulative probability

*F*

1

*x*

2

=

*P*

1

*X*

...

*x*

2

for a specified mean and standard deviation. (If

*cumulative*

is set to

*FALSE*

, the function simply calculates the value of the density function

*f*

(

*x*

), which has

little practical application other than tabulating values of the density function. This was   
used to draw the distrib[utions in Figure 5.18 using Excel.)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#228)

Using the NORM.DIST Function to Compute Normal Probabilities

Suppose that a company has determined that the distri-  
bution of customer demand (

X

) is normal with a mean of

750 units/month and a standard deviation of 100 units/  
[month. Figure 5.19 shows some cumulative probabilities](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#229)calculated with the NORM.DIST function (see the Excel file

Normal Probabilities

). The company would like to know the

following:

1.

What is the probability that demand will be at most   
900 units?

2.

What is the probability that demand will exceed   
700 units?

3.

What is the probability that demand will be between   
700 and 900 units?

To answer the questions, first draw a picture. This helps to   
ensure that you know what area you are trying to calculate   
and how to use the formulas for working with a cumulative   
distribution correctly.

Question 1.

[Figure 5.20(a) shows the probability that](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#230)

demand will be at most 900 units, or

P

(

X

...

900).

This is simply the cumulative probability for

x

=

900,

which can be calculated using the Excel function

=

NORM.DIST(900, 750, 100, TRUE)

=

0.9332.

Question 2.

[Figure 5.20(b) shows the probability that](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#230)

demand will exceed 700 units,

P

(

X

7

700). Using the

principles we have previously discussed, this can be   
found by subtracting

P

(

This can be computed in Excel using the formula

Question 3.

The probability that demand will be

between 700 and 900,

With the NORM.DIST function, we are given a value,

*x*

, of the random variable

*X*

and can

find the cumulative probability to the left of

*x*

. Now let's reverse the problem. Suppose that

we know the cumulative probability but don't know the value of

*x*

. How can we find it?

We are often faced with such a question in many applications. The Excel function NORM.  
INV(

,

,

) can be used to do this. In this function,

*probability*

is the cumulative probability value corresponding to the value of

probability must be 1

we can see that the correct value must be somewhere   
between 850 and 900 because

0.8413 and

F

(900)

=

0.9332. We can find the exact value using the

Excel function

878.155.

Therefore, a demand of approximately 878 will satisfy the   
criterion.

We have previously noted that the empirical rules apply   
to any normal distribution. Let us find the areas under   
the standard normal distribution within 1, 2, and 3 stan-

Although it is quite easy to use Excel to compute normal probabilities, tables of the stan-  
dard normal distribution are commonly found in textbooks and professional references   
when a computer is not available. Such a table is pro[vided in Table A.1 of](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#662)Appendix A at

One of the advantages of the standard normal distribution is that we may compute

probabilities for any normal random variable

having a mean

by converting it to a standard normal random variable

. We introduced the concept of

standardized values (

The

**exponential distribution**

is a continuous distribution that models the time between

randomly occurring events. Thus, it is often used in such applications as modeling the   
time between customer arrivals to a service system or the time to or between failures of   
machines, lightbulbs, hard drives, and other mechanical or electrical components.

Similar to the Poisson distribution, the exponential distribution has one parameter,

l

. In fact, the exponential distribution is closely related to the Poisson distribution; if the

number of events occurring

*during*

an interval of time has a Poisson distribution, then the

time

*between*

events is exponentially distributed. For instance, if the number of arrivals at

a bank is Poisson-distributed, say with mean

l

=

12

\>

hour, then the time between arrivals

is exponential, with mean

m

=

1

\>

12 hour, or 5 minutes.

phenomena. For example, triangular distribution is often used when no data are available   
to characterize an uncertain variable and the distribution must be estimated judgmentally.

Probability Distributions and Data Modeling

these variables. Using the tools we have studied, we may construct frequency distributions   
and histograms and compute basic descriptive statistical measures to better understand the   
nature of the data. However, sample data are just that---samples.

Using sample data may limit our ability to predict uncertain events that may occur

because potential values

*outside*

the range of the sample data are not included. A bet-

ter approach is to identify the underlying probability distribution from which sample data   
come by "fitting" a theoretical distribution to the data and verifying the goodness of fit   
statistically.

To select an appropriate theoretical distribution that fits sample data, we might begin

by examining a histogram of the data to look for the distinctive shapes of particular distri-  
butions. For example, normal data are symmetric, with a peak in the middle. Exponential   
data are very positively skewed, with no negative values. This approach is not, of course,   
always accurate or valid, and sometimes it can be difficult to apply, especially if sample   
sizes are small. However, it may narrow the search down to a few potential distributions.

Summary statistics, such as the mean, median, standard deviation, and coefficient of

variation, often provide information about the nature of the distribution. For instance, nor-  
mally distributed data tend to have a fairly low coefficient of variation (however, this may   
not be true if the mean is small). For normally distributed data, we would also expect the   
median and mean to be approximately the same. For exponentially distributed data, how-  
ever, the median will be less than the mean. Also, we would expect the mean to be about   
equal to the standard deviation, or, equivalently, the coefficient of variation would be close   
to 1. We could also look at the skewness index. For instance, normal data are not skewed.   
The following examples illustrate some of these ideas.

The examination of histograms and summary statistics might provide some idea of the

appropriate distribution; however, a better approach is to analytically fit the data to the best   
type of probability distribution.

EXAMPLE 5.39

Analyzing Airline Passenger Data

An airline operates a daily route between two medium-sized   
cities using a 70-seat regional jet. The flight is rarely booked   
to capacity but often accommodates business travelers   
[who book at the last minute at a high price. Figure 5.26](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#236)shows the number of passengers for a sample of 25 flights   
(Excel file

Airline Passengers

). The histogram shows a rela-

tively symmetric distribution. The mean, median, and mode   
are all similar, although there is some degree of positive

[skewness. From our discussion in Chapter 4 about the vari-](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144)ability of samples, it is important to recognize that although   
[the histogram in Figure 5.26 does not look perfectly normal,]()this is a relatively small sample that can exhibit a lot of vari-  
ability compared with the population from which it is drawn.   
Thus, based on these characteristics, it would not be unrea-  
sonable to assume a normal distribution for the purpose of   
developing a predictive or prescriptive analytics model.

EXAMPLE 5.40

Analyzing Airport Service Times

[Figure 5.27 shows a portion of the data and statistical](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#236)analysis of 812 samples of service times at an airport's   
ticketing counter (Excel file

Airport Service Times

). The

data certainly do not appear to be normal or uniform. The   
histogram appears to look like an exponential distribution,   
and this might be a reasonable choice. However, there is a

difference between the mean and standard deviation, which   
we would not expect to see for an exponential distribution.   
Some other exotic distribution that we have not introduced   
might be more appropriate. Identifying the best fitting dis-  
tribution can be done using sophisticated software.

The basis for fitting data to a probability distribution is a statistical procedure called

**good-**

**ness of fit**

. Goodness of fit attempts to draw a conclusion about the

*nature*

of the distribu-

tion. F[or instance, in Example 5.39 we suggested that it might be reasonable to assume that](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#235)the distribution of passenger demand is normal. Goodness of fit would provide objective,   
analytical support for this assumption. We can do this using a procedure called the chi-  
square goodness of fit test.

The

**chi-square goodness of fit test**

can be used to determine whether sample data are rep-

resentative of some probability distribution. We will explain the theory behind this test in   
[Chapter 7; here, you simply need to understand the calcul](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#276)ations. Example 5.41 illustrates   
its application for a normal distribution.

The chi-square test can be applied to many distributions; the only modification to the

procedure that must be made is to use the proper function to find the cumulative prob-  
abilities of the observed frequency distribution. For example, if we suspect that data follow   
an exponential distribution, then use

=

EXPON.DIST(

), where

*lambda*

is 1/sample mean. For a uniform distribution, the probabilities can be computed

easily using simple geometry, lik[e we did in Example 5.33.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#227)

See question 3 in Example 5.34 for using](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#229)the NORM.DIST function. This is computed in column D   
of the spreadsheet.

4.

Multiply the bin probabilities by the number of   
observations (in this case, 25). These values are the   
expected frequencies that you would see if the normal   
distribution were the correct data model. These are   
computed in column E of the spreadsheet.

normal distribution is not appropriate to model the data.

To illustrate the importance of identifying the correct dis-  
tribution in decision modeling, we discuss an example in   
advertising.

3

The amount that companies spend on the

creative component of advertising (that is, making better   
ads) is traditionally quite small relative to the overall media   
budget. One expert noted that the expenditure on creative   
development was about 5% of that spent on the media   
delivery campaign.

Whatever money is spent on creative development

is usually directed through a single advertising agency.   
However, one theory that has been proposed is that   
more should be spent on creative ad development, and   
the expenditures should be spread across a number of   
competitive advertising agencies. In research studies of   
this theory, the distribution of advertising effectiveness   
was assumed to be normal. In reality, data collected on   
the response to consumer product ads show that this   
distribution is actually quite skewed and, therefore, not   
normally distributed. Using the wrong assumption in any   
model or application can produce erroneous results. In   
this situation, the skewness actually provides an advan-  
tage for advertisers, making it more effective to obtain   
ideas from a variety of advertising agencies.

A mathematical model (called Gross's model)

relates the relative contributions of creative and media   
dollars to total advertising effectiveness and is often   
used to identify the best number of draft ads to pur-  
chase. This model includes factors of ad development   
cost, total media spending budget, the distribution of   
effectiveness across ads (assumed to be normal), and   
the unreliability of identifying the most effective ad from   
a set of independently generated alternatives. Gross's

[The Value of Good Data Modeling in Advertising](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#11)

multiple ads were obtained from independent sources, and   
the best ad is selected.

Since the data observed on ad effectiveness was clearly

skewed, other researchers examined ad effectiveness by   
studying standard industry data on ad recall without requiring   
the assumption of normally distributed effects. This analysis   
found that the best of a number of ads was more effective   
than any single ad. Further analysis revealed that the optimal   
number of ads to commission can vary significantly, depend-  
ing on the shape of the distribution of effectiveness for a   
single ad.

The researchers developed an alternative to Gross's

model. From their analyses, they found that as the number   
of draft ads was increased, the effectiveness of the best ad   
also increased. Both the optimal number of draft ads and   
the payoff from creating multiple independent drafts were   
higher

when the correct distribution was used

than the results

reported in Gross's original study.

The number of degrees of freedom used in the CHISQ.INV.RT function depends on

the type of distribution you are fitting. In general, degrees of freedom is the number of bins   
minus one minus the number of parameters of the distribution that are estimated from the   
data. For the normal distribution, we need to estimate two parameters --- the mean and   
standard deviation; thus, degrees of freedom equals the number of bins minus 3 (see step 7   
in Example 5.41). For the exponential distribution, we need only estimate one parameter,   
lambda, so the degrees of freedom are the number of bins minus 2.

(evenly distributed with the colors red and black)   
and two green numbers, 0 and 00, rotate in a shal-  
low bowl with a curved wall. A small ball is spun on   
the inside of the wall and drops into a pocket corre-  
sponding to one of the numbers. Players may make   
11 different types of bets by placing chips on differ-  
ent areas of the table. These include bets on a single   
number, two adjacent numbers, a row of three num-  
bers, a block of four numbers, two adjacent rows of   
six numbers, and the five number combinations of 0,   
00, 1, 2, and 3; bets on the numbers 1--18 or 19--36;   
the first, second, or third group of 12 numbers; a col-  
umn of 12 numbers; even or odd; and red or black.   
Payoffs differ by bet. For instance, a single-number   
bet pays 35 to 1 if it wins; a three-number bet pays   
11 to 1; a column bet pays 2 to 1; and a color bet   
pays even money.

PLE collects a variety of data from special studies, many   
of which are related to the quality of its products. The   
company collects data about functional test performance   
of its mowers after assembly; results from the past 30   
days are given in the worksheet

. In addition, many

in-process measurements are taken to ensure that manufac-  
turing processes remain in control and can produce accord-  
ing to design specifications. The worksheet

*Blade Weight*

shows 350 measurements of blade weights taken from the   
manufacturing process that produces mower blades dur-  
ing the most recent shift. Elizabeth Burke has asked you   
to study these data from an analytics perspective. Draw-  
ing upon your experience, you have developed a number   
of questions.

**1.**

For the mower test data, what distribution might be   
appropriate to model the failure of an individual mower?

**2.**

What fraction of mowers fails the functional perfor-  
mance test using all the mower test data?

**3.**

What is the probability of having

*x*

failures in the next

100 mowers tested, for

*x*

from 0 to 20?

**4.**

What is the average blade weight and how much   
variability is occurring in the measurements of blade   
weights?

**5.**

Assuming that the data are normal, what is the proba-  
bility that blade weights from this process will exceed   
5.20?

**6.**

What is the probability that blade weights will be less   
than 4.80?

**7.**

What is the actual percent of blade weights that   
exceed 5.20 or are less than 4.80 from the data in the   
worksheet?

**8.**

Is the process that makes the blades stable over time?   
That is, are there any apparent changes in the pattern   
of the blade weights?

**9.**

Could any of the blade weights be considered outliers,   
which might indicate a problem with the manufactur-  
ing process or materials?

**10.**

Is the assumption that blade weights are normally   
distributed justified?

Summarize all your findings to these questions in a   
well-written report.

Chapter 6

Sampling and Estimation

We discussed the difference between population and samples in [Chapter 4.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144)

Sampling is the foundation of statistical analysis. We use sample data in busi-

ness analytics applications for many purposes. For example, we might wish to

estimate the mean, variance, or proportion of a very large or unknown population;

provide values for inputs in decision models; understand customer satisfaction;

reach a conclusion as to which of several sales strategies is most effective; or

understand if a change in a process resulted in an improvement. In this chapter,

we discuss sampling methods, how they are used to estimate population param-

eters, and how we can assess the error inherent in sampling.

In your career, you will discover many opportunities to apply statistical sam-

pling and estimation. For example, marketing analysts routinely use surveys to

understand customer demographics, brand and product attribute preferences,

and customer satisfaction. Accounting professionals use sampling techniques to

audit invoices, accounts receivable, and freight bills. Operations managers use

sampling to verify the quality of incoming materials and production output. Human

resource managers use surveys and sampling techniques to evaluate employee

satisfaction. Companies in the entertainment industry routinely use sampling to

rate TV shows, movies, and video games. So, every time you are asked to com-

plete a survey, you are seeing sampling and estimation at work!

The first step in sampling is to design an effective sampling plan that will yield represen-  
tative samples of the populations under study. A

**sampling plan**

is a description of the

approach that is used to obtain samples from a population prior to any data collection   
activity. A sampling plan states

EXAMPLE 6.1

A Sampling Plan for a Market Research Study

Suppose that a company wants to understand how golf-  
ers might respond to a membership program that provides   
discounts at golf courses in the golfers' locality as well   
as across the country. The

objective

of a sampling study

might be to estimate the proportion of golfers who would   
likely subscribe to this program. The

target population

might be all golfers over 25 years old. However, identify-  
ing all golfers in America might be impossible. A practi-  
cal

population frame

might be a list of golfers who have

purchased equipment from national golf or sporting goods   
companies through which the discount card will be sold.   
The

operational procedures

for collecting the data might be

an e-mail link to a survey site or direct-mail questionnaire.   
The data might be stored in an Excel database;

statistical

tools

such as PivotTables and simple descriptive statistics

would be used to segment the respondents into differ-  
ent demographic groups and estimate their likelihood of   
responding positively.

Many types of sampling methods exist. Sampling methods can be

*subjective*

or

*probabi-*

*listic*

. Subjective methods include

**judgment sampling**

, in which expert judgment is used

to select the sample (survey the "best" customers), and

**convenience sampling**

, in which

samples are selected based on the ease with which the data can be collected (survey all   
customers who happen to visit this month). Probabilistic sampling involves selecting the   
items in the sample using some random procedure. Probabilistic sampling is necessary to   
draw valid statistical conclusions.

The most common probabilistic sampling approach is simple random sampling.

**Sim-**

**ple random sampling**

involves selecting items from a population so that every subset of

a given size has an equal chance of being selected. If the population data are stored in a   
database, simple random samples can generally be easily obtained.

EXAMPLE 6.2

Simple Random Sampling with Excel

Suppose that we wish to sample from the Excel database

Sales Transactions.

Excel provides a tool to generate a

random set of values from a given population size. Click   
on

Data Analysis

in the

Analysis

group of the

Data

tab

and select

Sampling

. This brings up the dialog shown in

[Figure 6.1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#251) In the

Input Range

box, we specify the data

range from which the sample will be taken. This tool   
requires that the data sampled be numeric, so in this   
example we sample from the first column of the data set,   
which corresponds to the customer ID number. There are   
two options for sampling:

1.

Sampling can be

Periodic

, and we will be prompted

for the

Period

, which is the interval between sample

observations from the beginning of the data set. For   
instance, if a period of 5 is used, observations 5, 10, 15,   
and so on will be selected as samples.

2.

Sampling can also be

Random

, and we will be

prompted for the

Number of Samples

. Excel will then

randomly select this number of samples from the speci-  
fied data set. However, this tool generates random sam-  
ples

with replacement

, so we must be careful to check

for duplicate observations in the sample created.

[Figure 6.2 shows 20 random samples generated by the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#251)

tool. We sorted them in ascending order to make it easier   
to identify duplicates. As you can see, two of the customers   
were duplicated by the tool.

222

Chapter 6

Sampling and Estimation

Other methods of sampling include the following:

■

***Systematic (Periodic) Sampling.***

**Systematic**

, or

**periodic**

,

**sampling**

is a sam-

pling plan (one of the options in the Excel

*Sampling*

tool) that selects every

*n*

th item from the population. For example, to sample 250 names from a list of

400,000, the first name could be selected at random from the first 1,600, and then   
every 1,600th name could be selected. This approach can be used for telephone   
sampling when supported by an automatic dialer that is programmed to dial   
numbers in a systematic manner. However, systematic sampling is not the same   
as simple random sampling because for any sample, every possible sample of a   
given size in the population does not have an equal chance of being selected. In   
some situations, this approach can induce significant bias if the population has   
some underlying pattern. For instance, sampling orders received every seven days   
may not yield a representative sample if customers tend to send orders on certain   
days every week.

■

***Stratified Sampling.***

**Stratified sampling**

applies to populations that are divided

into natural subsets (called

*strata*

) and allocates the appropriate proportion of

samples to each stratum. For example, a large city may be divided into political   
districts called wards. Each ward has a different number of citizens. A stratified   
sample would choose a sample of individuals in each ward proportionate to its   
size. This approach ensures that each stratum is weighted by its size relative to   
the population and can provide better results than simple random sampling if the   
items in each stratum are not homogeneous. However, issues of cost or signifi-  
cance of certain strata might make a disproportionate sample more useful. For   
example, the ethnic or racial mix of each ward might be significantly different,   
making it difficult for a stratified sample to obtain the desired information.

■

***Cluster Sampling.***

**Cluster sampling**

is based on dividing a population into sub-

groups (clusters), sampling a set of clusters, and (usually) conducting a complete   
census within the clusters sampled. For instance, a company might segment its   
customers into small geographical regions. A cluster sample would consist of   
a random sample of the geographical regions, and all customers within these   
regions would be surveyed (which might be easier because regional lists might   
be easier to produce and mail).

■

***Sampling from a Continuous Process.***

Selecting a sample from a continuous

manufacturing process can be accomplished in two main ways. First, select a   
time at random; then select the next

*n*

items produced after that time. Second,

select

*n*

times at random; then select the next item produced after each of these

times. The first approach generally ensures that the observations will come from   
a homogeneous population; however, the second approach might include items   
from different populations if the characteristics of the process should change over   
time, so caution should be used.

U.S. breweries rely on a three-tier distribution system to   
deliver product to retail outlets, such as supermarkets   
and convenience stores, and on-premise accounts,   
such as bars and restaurants. The three tiers are the   
manufacturer, wholesaler (distributor), and retailer. A

Sample data provide the basis for many useful analyses to support decision making.   

**Estimation**

involves assessing the value of an unknown population parameter---such as

a population mean, population proportion, or population variance---using sample data.

**Estimators**

are the measures used to estimate population parameters; for example, we use

the sample mean

*x*

to estimate a population mean

. The sample variance

*s*

estimates a

population variance

A

**point estimate**

is a single number derived from sample data that is used to estimate the

its distributors. A field quality specialist (FQS) audits dis-  
tributors within an assigned region of the country and col-  
lects data on these attributes. The FQS uses a handheld   
device to scan the universal product code on each pack-  
age to identify the product type and amount. When audits   
are complete, data are summarized and uploaded from the   
handheld device into a master database.

This distributor auditing uses stratified random sam-

pling with proportional allocation of samples based on the   
distributor's market share. In addition to providing a more   
representative sample and better logistical control of sam-  
pling, stratified random sampling enhances statistical preci-  
sion when data are aggregated by market area served by   
the distributor. This enhanced precision is a consequence   
of smaller and typically homogeneous market regions,   
which are able to provide realistic estimates of variability,   
especially when compared to another market region that is   
markedly different.

Randomization of retail accounts is achieved through

a specially designed program based on the GPS location   
of the distributor and serviced retail accounts. The sam-  
pling strategy ultimately addresses a specific distributor's   
performance related to out-of-code product, damaged   
product, and out-of-rotation product at the retail level.   
All in all, more than 6,000 of the brewery's national retail

accounts are audited during a sampling year. Data col-  
lected by the FQSs during the year are used to develop a   
performance ranking of distributors and identify opportu-  
nities for improvement.

Why is this so? Statisticians develop many types of estimators, and from a theoretical

as well as a practical perspective, it is important that they "truly estimate" the popula-  
tion parameters they are supposed to estimate. Suppose that we perform an experiment   
in which we repeatedly sampled from a population and computed a point estimate for a   
population parameter. Each individual point estimate will vary from the population param-  
eter; however, we would hope that the long-term average (expected value) of all possible   
point estimates would equal the population parameter. If the expected value of an estimator   
equals the population parameter it is intended to estimate, the estimator is said to be

*unbi-*

*ased*

. If this is not true, the estimator is called

*biased*

and will not provide correct results.

Fortunately, all the estimators we have introduced are unbiased and, therefore, are

meaningful for making decisions involving the population parameter. In particular, statisti-  
cians have shown that the denominator

*n*

is necessary to provide

an unbiased estimator of

s

. If we simply divided by the number of observations, the esti-

mator would tend to underestimate the true variance.

[Errors in Point Estimation](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#11)

One of the drawbacks of using point estimates is that they do not provide any indication   
of the magnitude of the potential error in the estimate. A major metropolitan newspaper   
reported that, based on a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey, college professors were the   
highest-paid workers in the region, with an average salary of $150,004. Actual averages for   
two local universities were less than $70,000. What happened? As reported in a follow-up   
story, the sample size was very small and included a large number of highly paid medical   
school faculty; as a result, there was a significant error in the point estimate that was used.

When we sample, the estimators we use---such as a sample mean, sample proportion,

or sample variance---are actually random variables that are characterized by some distri-  
bution. By knowing what this distribution is, we can use probability theory to quantify   
the uncertainty associated with the estimator. To understand this, we first need to discuss   
sampling error and sampling distributions.

In [Chapter 4, we observ](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144)ed that different samples from the same population have dif-

ferent characteristics---for example, variations in the mean, standard deviation, frequency   
distribution, and so on.

**Sampling (statistical) error**

occurs because samples are only a

subset of the total population. Sampling error is inherent in any sampling process, and   
although it can be minimized, it cannot be totally avoided. Another type of error, called

**nonsampling error**

, occurs when the sample does not represent the target population

adequately. This is generally a result of poor sample design, such as using a convenience   
sample when a simple random sample would have been more appropriate, or choosing the   
wrong population frame. It may also result from inadequate data reliability, which we dis-  
[cussed in Chapter 1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30)To draw good conclusions from samples, analysts need to eliminate   
nonsampling error and understand the nature of sampling error.

Sampling error depends on the size of the sample relative to the population. Thus,

determining the number of samples to take is essentially a statistical issue that is based on   
the accuracy of the estimates needed to draw a useful conclusion. We discuss this later in   
this chapter. However, from a practical standpoint, one must also consider the cost of sam-  
pling and sometimes make a trade-off between cost and the information that is obtained.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive255.png)

Suppose that we estimate the mean of a population using the sample mean. How can we   
determine how accurate we are? In other words, can we make an informed statement about   
how far the sample mean might be from the true population mean? We could gain some   
insight into this question by performing a sampling experiment as Example 6.3 illustrates.

If we apply the empirical rules to these results, we can estimate the sampling error

associated with one of the sample sizes we have chosen (see Example 6.4).

Figure 6.3 shows a portion of](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#255)a spreadsheet for this experiment, along with a histogram of   
the data (on the left side) that shows that the 250 observa-  
tions are approximately uniformly distributed. (This is avail-  
able in the Excel file

Sampling Experiment

.)

In row 12, we compute the mean of each sample.

These statistics vary a lot from the population values   
because of sampling error. The histogram on the right shows   
the distribution of the 25 sample means, which vary from   
less than 4 to more than 6. Now let's compute the average   
and standard deviation of the sample means in row 12 (cells

AB12 and AB13). Note that the average of all the sample   
means is quite close to the true population mean of 5.0.

Now let us repeat this experiment for larger sample

sizes.[Table 6.1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#256)shows some results. Notice that as the   
sample size gets larger, the averages of the 25 sample   
means are all still close to the expected value of 5; how-  
ever, the standard deviation of the 25 sample means   
becomes smaller for increasing sample sizes, meaning that   
the means of samples are clustered closer together around   
the true expected value.[Figure 6.4](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#256)shows comparative   
histograms of the sample means for each of these cases.   
These illustrate the conclusions we just made and, per-  
haps even more surprisingly, the distribution of the sample   
means appears to assume the shape of a normal distribu-  
tion for larger sample sizes. In our experiment, we used   
only 25 sample means. If we had used a much-larger num-  
ber, the distributions would have been more well defined.

We can quantify the sampling error in estimating the mean for any unknown population. To   
do this, we need to characterize the sampling distribution of the mean.

[Sampling Distribution of the Mean](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#11)

The means of

*all possible*

samples of a fixed size

*n*

from some population will form a

distribution that we call the

**sampling distribution of the mean**

. The histograms in

[Figure 6.4](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#256)are approximations to the sampling distributions of the mean based on   
25 samples. Statisticians have shown two key results about the sampling distribution of   
the mean. First, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean, called the

**standard error of the mean**

, is computed as

Standard Error of the Mean

=

s

\>

1

*n*

**(6.1)**

where

s

is the standard deviation of the population from which the individual observations

are drawn and

*n*

is the sample size. From this formula, we see that as

*n*

increases, the stan-

dard error decreases, just as our experiment demonstrated. This suggests that the estimates   
of the mean that we obtain from larger sample sizes provide greater accuracy in estimating   
the true population mean. In other words,

*larger sample sizes have less sampling error*

.

EXAMPLE 6.5

Computing the Standard Error of the Mean

For our experiment, we know that the variance of the popu-  
lation is 8.33 (because the values were uniformly distrib-  
uted). Therefore, the standard deviation of the population is

s

=

2.89. We may compute the standard error of the mean

[for each of the sample sizes in our experiment using for-
mula (6.1). For example, with](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#257)

of the mean based on using only 25 samples. If we compare these estimates with the theo-  
retical values in the previous example, we see that they are close but not exactly the same.   
This is because the true standard error is based on

*all possible*

sample means in the sam-

pling distribution, whereas we used only 25. If you repeat the experiment with a larger   
number of samples, the observed values of the standard error would be closer to these   
theoretical values.

In practice, we will never know the true population standard deviation and generally

take only a limited sample of

*n*

observations. However, we may estimate the standard error

of the mean using the sample data by simply dividing the sample standard deviation by the   
square root of

*n*

.

The second result that statisticians have shown is called the

**central limit theorem**

,

one of the most important practical results in statistics that makes systematic inference   
possible. The central limit theorem states that if the sample size is large enough, the sam-  
pling distribution of the mean is approximately normally distributed,

*regardless*

of the dis-

tribution of the population, and that the mean of the sampling distribution will be the same

as that of the population. This is exactly what we observed in our experiment. The distribu-  
tion of the population was uniform, yet the sampling distribution of the mean converges to   
the shape of a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The central limit theorem   
also states that if the population is normally distributed, then the sampling distribution of   
the mean will also be normal for

*any*

sample size. The central limit theorem allows us to

use the theory we learned about calculating probabilities for normal distributions to draw   
conclusions about sample means.

The key to applying sampling distribution of the mean correctly is to understand whether   
the probability that you wish to compute relates to an individual observation or to the mean   
of a sample. If it relates to the mean of a sample, then you must use the sampling distribu-  
tion of the mean, whose standard deviation is the standard error,

EXAMPLE 6.6

Using the Standard Error in Probability Calculations

Suppose that the size of individual customer orders (in   
dollars),

X

, from a major discount book publisher Web site

is normally distributed with a mean of $36 and standard   
deviation of $8. The probability that the next individual who   
places an order at the Web site will make a purchase of   
more than $40 can be found by calculating

Now suppose that a sample of 16 customers is chosen.

What is the probability that the

for these 16

customers will exceed $40? To find this, we must realize that   
we must use the sampling distribution of the mean to carry   
out the appropriate calculations. The sampling distribution

of the mean will have a mean of $36 but a standard error   
of

chases exceeding $40, the chance that 16 customers

It would be very unlikely for all 16 customers to make   
high-volume purchases, because some individual pur-  
chases would as likely be less than $36 as more, making   
the variability of the mean purchase amount for the sam-  
ple of 16 much smaller than that for individuals.

An

**interval estimate**

provides a range for a population characteristic based on a sample.

Intervals are quite useful in statistics because they provide more information than a point

distribution, the mean plus or minus 1 standard deviation describes an approximate 68%   
probability interval around the mean. As another example, the 5th and 95th percentiles in a   
data set constitute a 90% probability interval.

EXAMPLE 6.7

Interval Estimates in the News

We see interval estimates in the news all the time when trying   
to estimate the mean or proportion of a population. Interval   
estimates are often constructed by taking a point estimate   
and adding and subtracting a margin of error that is based on   
the sample size. For example, a Gallup poll might report that   
56% of voters support a certain candidate with a margin of   
error of

{

3

%

. We would conclude that the true percentage of

voters that support the candidate is most likely between 53%   
and 59%. Therefore, we would have a lot of confidence in pre-  
dicting that the candidate would win a forthcoming election. If,   
however, the poll showed a 52% level of support with a mar-  
gin of error of

{

4

%

, we might not be as confident in predict-

ing a win because the true percentage of supportive voters is   
likely to be somewhere between 48% and 56%.

The question you might be asking at this point is how to calculate the error associ-

ated with a point estimate. In national surveys and political polls, such margins of error   
are usually stated, but they are never properly explained. To understand them, we need to   
introduce the concept of confidence intervals.

[Confidence Intervals](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#11)

Confidence interval estimates provide a way of assessing the accuracy of a point estimate.   
A

**confidence interval**

is a range of values between which the value of the population

parameter is believed to be, along with a probability that the interval correctly estimates the   
true (unknown) population parameter. This probability is called the

**level of confidence**

,

denoted by 1

-

a

, where

a

is a number between 0 and 1. The level of confidence is usu-

ally expressed as a percent; common values are 90%, 95%, or 99%. (Note that if the level   
of confidence is 90%, then

a

=

0.1.) The margin of error depends on the level of confi-

dence and the sample size. For example, suppose that the margin of error for some sample   
size and a level of confidence of 95% is calculated to be 2.0. One sample might yield a   
point estimate of 10. Then, a 95% confidence interval would be \[8, 12\]. However, this   
interval may or may not include the true population mean. If we take a different sample, we   
will most likely have a different point estimate, say, 10.4, which, given the same margin of   
error, would yield the interval estimate \[8.4, 12.4\]. Again, this may or may not include the   
true population mean. If we chose 100 different samples, leading to 100 different interval   
estimates, we would expect that 95% of them---the level of confidence---would contain the   
true population mean. We would say we are "95% confident" that the interval we obtain   
from sample data contains the true population mean. The higher the confidence level, the   
more assurance we have that the interval contains the true population parameter. As the   
confidence level increases, the confidence interval becomes wider to provide higher lev-  
els of assurance. You can view

a

as the risk of incorrectly concluding that the confidence

interval contains the true mean.

When national surveys or political polls report an interval estimate, they are actually

confidence intervals. However, the level of confidence is generally not stated because the   
average person would probably not understand the concept or terminology. While not stated,   
you can probably assume that the level of confidence is 95%, as this is the most common   
value used in practice (however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics tends to use 90% quite often).

Many different types of confidence intervals may be developed. The formulas used

depend on the population parameter we are trying to estimate and possibly other character-  
istics or assumptions about the population. We illustrate a few types of confidence intervals.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive260.png)

The simplest type of confidence interval is for the mean of a population where the standard   
deviation is assumed to be known. You should realize, however, that in nearly all practical   
sampling applications, the population standard deviation will

*not*

be known. However, in

some applications, such as measurements of parts from an automated machine, a process   
might have a very stable variance that has been established over a long history, and it can   
reasonably be assumed that the standard deviation is known.

Computing a Confidence Interval with a Known Standard Deviation

Chapter 6

Sampling and Estimation

As the level of confidence, 1

, decreases,

*z*

a

decreases, and the confidence inter-

val becomes narrower. For example, a 90% confidence interval will be narrower than a   
95% confidence interval. Similarly, a 99% confidence interval will be wider than a 95%   
confidence interval. Essentially, you must trade off a higher level of accuracy with the risk   
that the confidence interval does not contain the true mean. Smaller risk will result in a   
wider confidence interval. However, you can also see that as the sample size increases, the   
standard error decreases, making the confidence interval narrower and providing a more   
accurate interval estimate for the same level of risk. So if you wish to reduce the risk, you   
should consider increasing the sample size.

In most practical applications, the standard deviation of the population is unknown, and we   
need to calculate the confidence interval differently. Before we can discuss how to compute   
this type of confidence interval, we need to introduce a new probability distribution called   
the

***t***

**-distribution**

. The

*t*

-distribution is actually a family of probability distributions with a

shape similar to the standard normal distribution. Different

*t*

-distributions are distinguished

by an additional parameter,

**degrees of freedom**

(

***df***

). The

*t*

-distribution has a larger variance

than the standard normal, thus making confidence intervals wider than those obtained from   
the standard normal distribution, in essence, correcting for the uncertainty about the true   
standard deviation, which is not known. As the number of degrees of freedom increases, the

*t*

-distribution converges to the standard normal distribution [( Figure 6.6)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#261). When sample sizes

get to be as large as 120, the distributions are virtually identical; even for sample sizes as low   
as 30 to 35, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the two. Thus, for large sample sizes,   
many people use

*z*

-values as i[n formula (6.2)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#260)to establish confidence intervals even when

the population standard deviation is unknown but estimated from the sample data. We must   
point out, however, that for any sample size, the

*true*

sampling distribution of the mean is the

*t*

-distribution; so when in doubt, use the

*t*

-distribution as we will illustrate in the next section.

The concept of degrees of freedom can be puzzling. It can best be explained by exam-

ining the formula for the sample variance:

. If we know the value

of the mean, then we need know only

*n*

-

1 distinct observations; the

th is completely

determined. (For instance, if the mean of three numbers is 4 and you know that two of   
the numbers are 2 and 4, you can easily determine that the third number must be 6.) The

number of sample values that are free to vary defines the number of degrees of freedom; in   
general,

*df*

equals the number of sample values minus the number of estimated parameters.

Because the sample variance uses one estimated parameter, the mean, the

*t*

-distribution

used in confidence interval calculations has

*n*

1 degrees of freedom. Because the

*t*

tribution explicitly accounts for the effect of the sample size in estimating the population   
variance, it is the proper one to use for any sample size. However, for large samples, the   
difference between

Confidence intervals may be calculated for other population parameters such as a variance   
or standard deviation and also for differences in the means or proportions of two popula-  
tions. The concepts are similar to the types of confidence intervals we have discussed, but   
many of the formulas are rather complex and more difficult to implement on a spreadsheet.   
Some advanced software packages and spreadsheet add-ins provide additional support.   
Therefore, we do not discuss them in this book, but we do suggest that you consult other   
books and statistical references should you need to use them, now that you understand the

796 milliliters. Does this indicate a serious problem? Not   
necessarily. The 95% confidence interval for the mean we   
[computed in Figure 6.5 was \[790.12, 801.88\]. Although the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#260)sample mean is less than 800, the sample does not provide   
sufficient evidence to draw the conclusion that the popula-  
tion mean is less than 800 because 800 is contained within

the confidence interval. In fact, it is just as plausible that the   
population mean is 801. We cannot tell definitively because   
of the sampling error. However, suppose that the sample   
average is 792. Using the Excel worksheet

Population

Mean Sigma Known

in the workbook

Confidence Intervals

,

we find that the confidence interval for the mean would be   
\[786.12, 797.88\]. In this case, we would conclude that it   
is highly unlikely that the population mean is 800 milliliters   
because the confidence interval falls completely below 800;   
the manufacturer should check and adjust the equipment to   
meet the standard.

Chapter 6

Sampling and Estimation

The next example shows how to interpret a confidence interval for a proportion.

EXAMPLE 6.12

Using a Confidence Interval to Predict Election Returns

Suppose that an exit poll of 1,300 voters found that 692   
voted for a particular candidate in a two-person race. This   
represents a proportion of 53.23% of the sample. Could   
we conclude that the candidate will likely win the election?   
A 95% confidence interval for the proportion is \[0.505,   
0.559\]. This suggests that the population proportion of   
voters who favor this candidate is highly likely to exceed   
50%, so it is safe to predict the winner. On the other hand,

suppose that only 670 of the 1,300 voters voted for the   
candidate, a sample proportion of 0.515. The confidence   
interval for the population proportion is \[0.488, 0.543\]. Even   
though the sample proportion is larger than 50%, the sam-  
pling error is large, and the confidence interval suggests   
that it is reasonably likely that the true population propor-  
tion could be less than 50%, so it would not be wise to pre-  
dict the winner based on this information.

We may use confidence intervals and their visualiza-

tions to determine whether the means of two populations   
are significantly different from each other. The rule is simple:   
If the confidence intervals overlap, then you cannot conclude   
statistically that the means differ. However, if the confidence   
intervals do not overlap, then you can conclude that there   
is a statistical difference in the means. In [Example 6.13,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#265) for   
instance, suppose we wish to determine whether the mean   
of the 35--44 age group is significantly different from that of   
the 45--54 age group. In[Figure 6.11](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#265), we see that the con-  
fidence intervals overlap, so we cannot conclude that the   
means are significantly different. In the next chapter, we will   
discuss these concepts in a more formalized manner using a   
statistical approach called hypothesis testing.

We may use an Excel stock chart to visualize confidence intervals easily (the stock chart   
requires that you have at least three variables). This is particularly useful for comparing   
confidence intervals for different groups.

Another type of interval used in estimation is a prediction interval. A

**prediction interval**

is one that provides a range for predicting the value of a new observation from the same   
population. This is different from a confidence interval, which provides an interval esti-  
mate of a population parameter, such as the mean or proportion. A confidence interval is   
associated with the

ated with the distribution of the random variable itself.

Sampling and Estimation

[Confidence Intervals and Sample Size](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#11)

An important question in sampling is the size of the sample to take. Note that in all   
the formulas for confidence intervals, the sample size plays a critical role in determin-  
ing the width of the confidence interval. As the sample size increases, the width of the   
confidence interval decreases, providing a more accurate estimate of the true population   
parameter. In many applications, we would like to control the margin of error in a confi-  
dence interval. For example, in reporting voter preferences, we might wish to ensure that   
the margin of error is

{

2%. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to determine the appropri-

ate sample size needed to estimate the population parameter within a specified level of   
precision.

The formulas for determining sample sizes to achieve a given margin of error are

based on the confidence interval half-widths. For example, consider the confidence   
interval for the mean with a known population standard deviation we introduced in   
[formula (6.2)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#260):

Suppose we want the width of the confidence interval on either side of the mean (that

is, the margin of error) to be at most

**(6.6)**

Of course, we generally do not know the population standard deviation prior to finding

the sample size. A commonsense approach would be to take an initial sample to estimate   
the population standard deviation using the sample standard deviation

*s*

and determine the

required sample size, collecting additional data if needed. If the half-width of the resulting   
confidence interval is within the required margin of error, then we clearly have achieved   
our goal. If not, we can use the new sample standard deviation

*s*

to determine a new sample

size and collect additional data as needed. Note that if

*s*

changes significantly, we still

might not have achieved the desired precision and might have to repeat the process. Usu-  
ally, however, this will be unnecessary.

In a similar fashion, we can compute the sample size required to achieve a desired

confidence interval half-width for a proportion by solving the following equation (based   
[on formula (6.4) using the popul](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#263)ation proportion

Chapter 6

Sampling and Estimation

In practice, the value of

p

will not be known. You could use the sample proportion

from a preliminary sample as an estimate of

p

to plan the sample size, but this might

require several iterations and additional samples to find the sample size that yields the   
required precision. When no information is available, the most conservative estimate   
is to set

p

=

0.5. This maximizes the quantity

p

(1

p

) in the formula, resulting

in the sample size that will guarantee the required precision no matter what the true   
proportion is.

EXAMPLE 6.15

Sample Size Determination for the Mean

In the liquid detergent example ([Example 6.8](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#260)), the confidence   
interval we computed in[Figure 6.5](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#260)was \[790.12, 801.88\]. The   
width of the confidence interval is

{

5.88 milliliters, which rep-

resents the sampling error. Suppose the manufacturer would   
like the sampling error to be at most 3 milliliters. Using[formula
(6.6),](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#267) we may compute the required sample size as follows:

A survey of 50 young professionals found that they   
spent an average of $19.31 when dining out, with   
a standard deviation of $12.11. Can you conclude   
statistically that the population mean is greater than   
$18?

Statistical Inference

Managers need to know if the decisions they have made or are planning to

make are effective. For example, they might want to answer questions like the

following: Did an advertising campaign increase sales? Will product placement

in a grocery store make a difference? Did a new assembly method improve

productivity or quality in a factory? Many applications of business analytics

involve seeking statistical evidence that decisions or process changes have

met their objectives.

Statistical inference

focuses on drawing conclusions

about populations from samples. Statistical inference includes estimation

of population parameters and hypothesis testing, which is a technique that

allows you to draw valid statistical conclusions about the value of population

parameters or differences among them.

Hypothesis testing involves drawing inferences about two contrasting propositions (each   
called a

**hypothesis**

) relating to the value of one or more population parameters, such as

the mean, proportion, standard deviation, or variance. One of these propositions (called the

**null hypothesis**

) describes the existing theory or a belief that is accepted as valid unless

strong statistical evidence exists to the contrary. The second proposition (called the

**alter-**

**native hypothesis**

) is the complement of the null hypothesis; it must be true if the null

hypothesis is false. The null hypothesis is denoted by

*H*

0

, and the alternative hypothesis is

denoted by

*H*

1

. Using sample data, we either

**1.**

*reject*

the null hypothesis and conclude that the sample data provide sufficient

statistical evidence to support the alternative hypothesis, or

**2.**

*fail to reject*

the null hypothesis and conclude that the sample data do not sup-

port the alternative hypothesis.

If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, then we can only accept as valid the existing theory   
or belief, but we can never prove it.

A Legal Analogy for Hypothesis Testing

A good analogy for hypothesis testing is the U.S. legal   
system. In our system of justice, a defendant is innocent   
until proven guilty. The null hypothesis---our belief in the   
absence of any contradictory evidence---is not guilty,   
whereas the alternative hypothesis is guilty. If the evidence   
(sample data) strongly indicates that the defendant is

guilty, then we reject the assumption of innocence. If the   
evidence is not sufficient to indicate guilt, then we can-  
not reject the not guilty hypothesis; however, we haven't

*proven*

that the defendant is innocent. In reality, you can

only conclude that a defendant is guilty from the evidence;   
you still have not proven it!

A

**one-sample hypothesis test**

is one that involves a single population parameter, such as the

mean, proportion, standard deviation, and so on. To conduct the test, we use a single sample   
of data from the population

We may conduct three types of one-sample hypothesis tests:

Notice that one-sample tests always compare a population parameter to some constant. For   
one-sample tests, the statements of the null hypotheses are expressed as

Ú

,

...

, or

=

.

It is

*not correct*

to formulate a null hypothesis using

7

,

6

, or

∙

.

How do we determine the proper form of the null and alternative hypotheses? Hypoth-

esis testing always

*assumes*

that

*H*

0

is true and uses sample data to determine whether

*H*

1

is more likely to be true. Statistically, we cannot "prove" that

*H*

0

is true; we can only

*fail*

*to reject*

it. Thus, if we cannot reject the null hypothesis, we have shown only that there is

insufficient evidence to conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true. However, rejecting   
the null hypothesis provides strong evidence (in a statistical sense) that the null hypothesis   
is not true and that the alternative hypothesis is true. Therefore, what we wish to provide   
evidence for statistically should be identified as the alternative hypothesis.

Formulating a One-Sample Test of Hypothesis

CadSoft, a producer of computer-aided design software   
for the aerospace industry, receives numerous calls for   
technical support. In the past, the average response time   
has been at least 25 minutes. The company has upgraded   
its information systems and believes that this will help   
reduce response time. As a result, it believes that the aver-  
age response time can be reduced to less than 25 minutes.   
The company collected a sample of 44 response times in   
the Excel file

*CadSoft Technical Support Response Times*

[(see Figure 7.1).](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#279)

If the new information system makes a difference, then

data should be able to confirm that the mean response

time is less than 25 minutes; this defines the alternative   
hypothesis,

*H*

1

.

Therefore, the proper statements of the null and alter-

native hypotheses are

*H*

0

:

population mean response time

Ú

25 minutes

*H*

1

:

population mean response time

6

25 minutes

We would typically write this using the proper symbol

for the population parameter. In this case, letting

m

be the

mean response time, we would write:

We already know that sample data can show considerable variation; therefore, conclusions   
based on sample data may be wrong. Hypothesis testing can result in one of four different   
outcomes:

**1.**

The null hypothesis is actually

*true*

, and the test

*correctly fails to reject it*

.

**2.**

The null hypothesis is actually

*false*

, and the hypothesis test

*correctly reaches*

*this conclusion*

.

**3.**

The null hypothesis is actually

*true*

, but the hypothesis test

*incorrectly rejects it*

(called

**Type I error**

).

**4.**

The null hypothesis is actually

*false*

, but the hypothesis test

*incorrectly fails to*

*reject it*

(called

**Type II error**

).

The probability of making a Type I error, that is,

*P*

(rejecting

*H*

0

∙

*H*

0

is true), is denoted

by

a

and is called the

**level of significance**

. This defines the likelihood that you will make the

incorrect conclusion that the alternative hypothesis is true when, in fact, the null hypothesis is   
true. The value of

a

can be controlled by the decision maker and is selected before the test is

conducted. Commonly used levels for

a

are 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01.

The probability of

*correctly failing to reject*

the null hypothesis, or

*P*

(not rejecting

*H*

0

∙

*H*

0

is true), is called the

**confidence coefficient**

and is calculated as 1

-

a

. A confi-

dence coefficient of 0.95 means that we expect 95 out of 100 samples to support the null   
hypothesis rather than the alternate hypothesis when

*H*

0

is actually true.

How

B

Depends on the True Population Mean

Consider the hypotheses in the CadSoft example:

*H*

0

:

mean response time

Ú

25 minutes

*H*

1

:

mean response time

6

25 minutes

If the true mean response from which the sample is drawn   
is, say, 15 minutes, we would expect to have a much   
smaller probability of incorrectly concluding that the null   
hypothesis is true than when the true mean response is   
24 minutes, for example. If the true mean were 15 minutes,   
the sample mean would very likely be much less than 25,   
leading us to reject

*H*

0

. If the true mean were 24 minutes,

even though it is less than 25, we would have a much   
higher probability of failing to reject

*H*

0

because a higher

likelihood exists that the sample mean would be greater   
than 25 due to sampling error. Thus, the farther away the   
true mean response time is from the hypothesized value,   
the smaller is

b

.

Generally, as

a

decreases,

b

increases,

so the decision maker must consider the trade-offs of   
these risks. So if you choose a level of significance of 0.01   
instead of 0.05 and keep the sample size constant, you   
would reduce the probability of a Type I error but increase   
the probability of a Type II error.

Unfortunately, we cannot control the probability of a Type II error,

*P*

(not rejecting

*H*

0

∙

*H*

0

is false), which is denoted by

b

. Unlike

a

,

b

cannot be specified in advance but

depends on the true value of the (unknown) population parameter (see Example 7.3).

The value 1

-

b

is called the

**power of the test**

and represents the probability of

*cor-*

*rectly rejecting*

the null hypothesis when it is indeed false, or

*P*

(rejecting

*H*

0

∙

*H*

0

is false).

We would like the power of the test to be high (equivalently, we would like the probability   
of a Type II error to be low) to allow us to make a valid conclusion. The power of the test is   
sensitive to the sample size; small sample sizes generally result in a low value of 1

-

b

. The

power of the test can be increased by taking larger samples, which enable us to detect small   
differences between the sample statistics and population parameters with more accuracy.   
However, a larger sample size incurs higher costs, giving new meaning to the adage there is   
no such thing as a free lunch. This suggests that if you choose a small level of significance,   
you should try to compensate by having a large sample size when you conduct the test.

The next step is to collect sample data and use the data to draw a conclusion. The decision   
to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis is based on computing a

*test statistic*

from the

sample data. The test statistic used depends on the type of hypothesis test. Different types   
of hypothesis tests use different test statistics, and it is important to use the correct one.   
The proper test statistic often depends on certain assumptions about the population---for   
example, whether or not the standard deviation is known. In the vast majority of practical   
applications, the population standard deviation is unknown. The following formulas show   
two types of one-sample hypothesis tests for means and their associated test statistics. The   
value of

m

0

is the hypothesized value of the population mean, that is, the "constant" in the

hypothesis formulation.

The conclusion to reject or fail to reject

is based on comparing the value of the test

statistic to a "critical value" from the sampling distribution of the test statistic when the   
null hypothesis is true and the chosen level of significance,

a

. The sampling distribution of

the test statistic is usually the normal distribution,

distribution. For example, the sampling distribution of the

a standard normal distribution; the

*t*

-distribution with

*n*

-

1 degrees of freedom. For a one-tailed test, the critical value is the number of standard

errors away from the hypothesized value for which the probability of exceeding the critical   
value is

a

. If

a

=

0.05, for example, then we are saying that there is only a 5% chance that

a sample mean will be that far away from the hypothesized value purely because of sam-  
pling error. Should this occur, it suggests that the true population mean is different from   
what was hypothesized.

The critical value divides the sampling distribution into two parts, a

*rejection region*

and a

*nonrejection region*

. If the null hypothesis is false, it is more likely that the test sta-

tistic will fall into the rejection region. If it does, we reject the null hypothesis; otherwise,   
we fail to reject it. The rejection region is chosen so that the probability of the test statistic   
falling into it if

*H*

0

is true is the probability of a Type I error,

a

.

The rejection region occurs in the tails of the sampling distribution of the test

statistic and depends on the structure of the hypothesis test, as shown in [Figure 7.2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#282)If the null hypothesis is structured as

and the alternative hypothesis as

, then

we would reject

if the test statistic is

*either*

significantly high or low. In this case,

the rejection region will occur in

the upper and lower tail of the distribution \[see

**two-tailed test of hypothesis**

. Because the probability

Computing the Test Statistic

For the CadSoft example, the average response time for the   
sample of 44 customers is

*x*

=

21.91 minutes and the sample

standard deviation is

*s*

=

19.49. The hypothesized mean is

m

0

=

25. You might wonder why we have to test the hypoth-

esis statistically when the sample average of 21.91 is clearly   
less than 25. We do because of sampling error. It is quite   
possible that the population mean truly is 25 or more and that   
we were lucky to draw a sample whose mean was smaller.   
Because of potential sampling error, it would be dangerous to   
conclude that the company was meeting its goal just by look-  
ing at the sample mean without better statistical evidence.

Because we don't know the value of the population stan-

dard deviation, the proper test statistic to use i[s formula (7.2):](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#280)

Observe that the numerator is the distance between the   
sample mean (21.91) and the hypothesized value (25). By   
dividing by the standard error, the value of

*t*

represents the

number of standard errors the sample mean is from the   
hypothesized value. In this case, the sample mean is 1.05   
standard errors below the hypothesized value of 25. This   
notion provides the fundamental basis for the hypoth-  
esis test---if the sample mean is "too far" away from the   
hypothesized value, then the null hypothesis should be   
rejected.

The other types of hypothesis tests, which specify a direction of relationship (where

*H*

0

is either

Ú

or

...

), are called

**one-tailed tests of hypothesis**

. In this case, the rejection

region occurs only in one tail of the distrib[ution \[see Figure 7.2(b)\]. Determining the cor](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#282)-  
rect tail of the distribution to use as the rejection region for a one-tailed test is easy. If

*H*

1

is

stated as

6

, the rejection region is in the lower tail; if

*H*

1

is stated as

7

, the rejection region

is in the upper tail (just think of the inequality associated with the alternative hypothesis as   
an arrow pointing to the proper tail direction).

Two-tailed tests have both upper and lower critical values, whereas one-tailed tests

have either a lower or an upper critical value. For standard normal and

*t*

-distributions,

which have a mean of zero, lower-tail critical values are negative; upper-tail critical values   
are positive.

Critical values make it easy to determine whether or not the test statistic falls in the

rejection region of the proper sampling distribution. For example, for an upper one-tailed   
test, if the test statistic is greater than the critical value, the decision would be to reject the   
null hypothesis. Similarly, for a lower one-tailed test, if the test statistic is less than the   
critical value, we would reject the null hypothesis. For a two-tailed test, if the test statistic   
is

*either*

greater than the upper critical value or less than the lower critical value, the deci-

sion would be to reject the null hypothesis.

The critical value for a one-sample, one-tailed test when the standard deviation is

unknown is the value of the

the sample mean is less than 25, we cannot conclude that the   
population mean response time is less than 25 because of the   
large amount of sampling error.

Basically, all hypothesis tests are similar; you just have to ensure that you select the cor-  
rect test statistic, critical value, and rejection region, depending on the type of hypothesis.

An alternative approach to comparing a test statistic to a critical value in hypothesis testing   
is to find the probability of obtaining a test statistic value equal to or more extreme than   
that obtained from the sample data when the null hypothesis is true. This probability is   
commonly called a

***p***

**-value**

, or

**observed significance level**

. The magnitude of a

*p*

-value

indicates the compatibility or incompatibility of the data with the null hypothesis. The   
smaller the

*p*

-value, the greater the statistical incompatibility with the null hypothesis.

The

*p*

-value does

*not*

measure the probability that the null hypothesis is true!

It is common practice to compare

*p*

hypothesis test. To draw a conclusion, compare the

The statistical community has questioned this practice. The American Statistical

Association has noted

1

*Practices that reduce data analysis or scientific inference to mechanical "bright-line"
rules (such as "p*

6

0.05

*") for justifying scientific claims or conclusions can lead to*

*erroneous beliefs and poor decision-making. A conclusion does not immediately become
"true" on one side of the divide and "false" on the other. Researchers should bring many
contextual factors into play to derive scientific inferences, including the design of a study,
the quality of the measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study,
and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis. Pragmatic considerations
often require binary, "yes-no" decisions, but this does not mean that p-values alone can
ensure that a decision is correct or incorrect. The widespread use of "statistical signifi-
cance" (generally interpreted as "p*

...

0.05

*") as a license for making a claim of a sci-*

*entific finding (or implied truth) leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process.*

As a result,

*p*

-values should be interpreted cautiously.

In other words,

there is about a 15% chance that the test statistic would

be

1.05 or smaller if the null hypothesis were true. This is

a fairly high probability, so it would be difficult to conclude   
that the true mean is less than 25 and we could attribute the   
fact that the test statistic is less than the hypothesized value   
to sampling error alone and not reject the null hypothesis.

Many important business measures, such as market share or the fraction of deliveries   
received on time, are expressed as proportions. We may conduct a test of hypothesis about   
a population proportion in a similar fashion as we did for means. The test statistic for a   
one-sample test for proportions is

where

p

is the hypothesized value and

*p*

n

is the sample proportion. Similar to the test

statistic for means, the

*z-*

test statistic shows the number of standard errors that the sample

proportion is from the hypothesized value. The sampling distribution of this test statistic   
has a standard normal distribution.

For a lower-tailed test, the

*p*

-value would be computed by the area to the left of the

test statistic; that is,

=

NORM.S.DIST(

*z*

, TRUE). For an upper-tailed test, the

*p*

-value

would be the area to the right of the test statistic, or

NORM.S.DIST(

*z*

If we had a two-tailed test, the

*p*

-value is computed by the Excel formula

NORM.S.DIST (ABS(

), TRUE)).

A One-Sample Test for the Proportion

CadSoft also sampled 44 customers and asked them to   
rate the overall quality of the company's software product   
using the following scale:

2---good  
3---very good  
4---excellent

These data can be found in the Excel File

satisfaction of quality by measuring the proportion of   
responses in the top two categories. In the past, this   
proportion has averaged about 75%. For these data,   
35 of the 44 responses, or 79.5%, are in the top two   
categories. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that   
this satisfaction measure has significantly exceeded 75%

using a significance level of 0.05? Answering this question

For one-tailed tests, we need to examine on which side of the hypothesized value the

confidence interval falls. For a lower-tailed test, if the confidence interval falls entirely   
below the hypothesized value, we reject the null hypothesis. For an upper-tailed test, if   
the confidence interval falls entirely above the hypothesized value, we also reject the null   
hypothesis.

eters. However, there are situations when we might want to determine if the parameters   
differ by some non-zero amount; for example, "job classification A makes at least $5,000   
more than job classification B."

These hypothesis-testing procedures are similar to those previously discussed in the

sense of computing a test statistic and comparing it to a critical value. However, the test   
statistics for two-sample tests are more complicated than those for one-sample tests and we   
will not delve into the mathematical details. Fortunately, Excel provides several tools for   
conducting two-sample tests, and we will use these in our e[xamples. Table 7.1 summarizes](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#289)the Excel

Selection of the proper test statistic and Excel procedure for a two-sample test for means   
depends on whether the population variances are known, and if not, whether they are   
assumed to be equal.

**1.**

*Population variance is known.*

In Excel, choose

*z-Test: Two-Sample for Means*

from the

*Data Analysis*

menu. This test uses a test statistic that is based on the

standard normal distribution.

**2.**

*Population variance is unknown and assumed unequal.*

From the

*Data Analysis*

menu, choose

*t*

-

*Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances*

. The test sta-

tistic for this case has a

*t*

-distribution.

**3.**

*Population variance is unknown but assumed equal.*

In Excel, choose

*t*

-

*Test:*

*Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances.*

The test statistic also has a

*t-*

distribu-

tion, but it is different from the unequal variance case.

These tools calculate the test statistic, the

*p*

-value for both a one-tailed and two-tailed test,

and the critical values for one-tailed and two-tailed tests. For the

*z*

-test with known popula-

tion variances, these are called

*z*

,

*P*

1

*Z*

...

*z*

2

*one-tail*

or

*P*

1

*Z*

...

*z*

2

*two-tail*

, and

*z Critical*

*one-tail*

or

*z Critical two-tail*

, respectively. For the

*t*

-tests, these are called

*t Stat*

,

*P*

1

*T*

...

*t*

2

*one-tail*

or

*P*

*T*

...

*t*

*two-tail*

, and

*t Critical one-tail*

or

*t Critical two-tail*

, respectively.

***Caution***

: You must be

*very careful*

in interpreting the output information from these

Excel tools and apply the following rules:

**1.**

If the test statistic is negative, the one-tailed

*p*

-value is the correct

*p*

-value for a

lower-tailed test; however, for an upper-tailed test, you must subtract this num-  
ber from 1.0 to get the correct

*p*

-value.

Comparing Supplier Performance

The last two columns in the

*Purchase Orders*

data file provide

the order date and arrival date of all orders placed with each   
supplier. The time between placement of an order and its   
arrival is commonly called the lead time. We may compute the   
lead time by subtracting the Excel date function values from   
each other (Arrival Date

-

Order Date), as shown in [Figure 7.7](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#290).

[Figure 7.8 shows a PivotTable for the average lead](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#291)

time for each supplier. Purchasing managers have noted   
that they order many of the same types of items from Alum   
Sheeting and Durrable Products and are considering drop-  
ping Alum Sheeting from their supplier base if its lead time   
is significantly longer than that of Durrable Products.   
Therefore, they would like to test the hypothesis

where

m

mean lead time for Alum Sheeting and

=

mean lead time for Durrable Products.

Rejecting the null hypothesis suggests that the

average lead time for Alum Sheeting is statistically   
longer than Durrable Products. However, if we cannot   
reject the null hypothesis, then even though the mean   
lead time for Alum Sheeting is longer, the difference   
would most likely be due to sampling error, and we   
could not conclude that there is a statistically significant   
difference.

If the test statistic is nonnegative (positive or zero), then the

*p*

-value in the out-

put is the correct

*p*

-value for an upper-tailed test; but for a lower-tailed test, you

must subtract this number from 1.0 to get the correct

*p*

-value.

**3.**

For a lower-tailed test, you must change the sign of the one-tailed critical value.

Only rarely are the population variances known; also, it is often difficult to justify the

assumption that the variances of each population are equal. Therefore, in most practical   
situations, we use the

*t*

-

*Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances*

. This procedure

also works well with small sample sizes if the populations are approximately normal. It is   
recommended that the size of each sample be approximately the same and total 20 or more.   
If the populations are highly skewed, then larger sample sizes are recommended.

provides information for both one-tailed and two-tailed   
tests. Because this is a one-tailed test, we use the high-  
[lighted information in Figure 7.10 to draw our conclusions.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#292)For this example,

*t Stat*

is positive and we have an upper-

tailed test; therefore, using the rules stated earlier, the

*p*

-value is 0.00166. Based on this alone, we reject the null

hypothesis and must conclude that Alum Sheeting has a   
statistically longer average lead time than Durrable Prod-  
ucts. We may draw the same conclusion by comparing the   
value of

*t Stat*

with the critical value

*t Critical one-tail*

. Being

an upper-tailed test, the value of

is 1.812.

In the previous example for testing differences in the mean supplier lead times, we used   
independent samples; that is, the orders in each supplier's sample were not related to each   
other. In many situations, data from two samples are naturally paired or matched. For   
example, suppose that a sample of assembly line workers perform a task using two differ-  
ent types of work methods, and the plant manager wants to determine if any differences   
exist between the two methods. In collecting the data, each worker will have performed

the task using each method. Had we used independent samples, we would have randomly   
selected two different groups of employees and assigned one work method to one group   
and the alternative method to the second group. Each worker would have performed the   
task using only one of the methods. As another example, suppose that we wish to compare   
retail prices of grocery items between two competing grocery stores. It makes little sense   
to compare different samples of items from each store. Instead, we would select a sample   
of grocery items and find the price charged for the same items by each store. In this case,   
the samples are paired because each item would have a price from each of the two stores.

When paired samples are used, a paired

data come from independent populations. The null hypothesis we test revolves around the

Using the Paired Two-Sample Test for Means

The Excel file

*Pile Foundation*

contains the estimates used in a

bid and actual auger-cast pile lengths that engineers ultimately   
had to use for a foundation-engineering project. The contractor's   
past experience suggested that the bid information was   
generally accurate, so the average of the paired differences   
between the actual pile lengths and estimated lengths should   
be close to zero. After this project was completed, the con-  
tractor found that the average difference between the actual   
lengths and the estimated lengths was 6.38. Could the con-  
tractor conclude that the bid information was poor?

[Figure 7.11 shows a portion of the data and the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#293)

because

value, we must reject the null hypothesis and conclude   
that the mean of the differences between the estimates

Note that the

Understanding variation in business processes is very important, as we have stated before.   
For instance, does one location or group of employees show higher variability than others?   
We can test for equality of variances between two samples using a new type of test, the

*F*

-test. To use this test, we must assume that both samples are drawn from normal popula-

tions. The hypotheses we test are

the end of the book provides only upper-tail critical values, and the distribution is not sym-

hypothesis test is really a two-tailed test, we will simplify it as a one-tailed test to make it   
easy to use tables of the

will use. We do this by ensuring that when we compute

sample variance to the smaller sample variance.

each variable. As we noted, you should ensure that the first   
variable has the larger variance; this might require you to   
calculate the variances

*before*

you use the tool. In this case,

the variance of the lead times for Alum Sheeting is larger   
[than the variance for Durrable Products (see Figure 7.10),](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#292)

so this is assigned to

*Variable 1*

. Note also that if we choose

a

[in the Excel dialog. The results are shown in Figure 7.13.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#294)

Chapter 7

Statistical Inference

If the variances differ significantly from each other, we would expect

*F*

to be much

larger than 1; the closer

*F*

is to 1, the more likely it is that the variances are the same.

Therefore, we need only to compare

*F*

to the upper-tailed critical value. Hence, for a level

of significance

test statistic exceeds the critical value. Note that we are

using

a

a

tailed information on which to base our conclusion.

The

means so that the proper test (population variance is unknown and assumed unequal or   
population variance is unknown and assumed equal, which we discussed earlier in this   
chapter) is selected.

To this point, we have discussed hypothesis tests that compare a population parameter to   
a constant value or that compare the means of two different populations. Often, we would   
like to compare the means of more than two groups to determine if all are equal or if any   
are significantly different from the rest.

We could sort the data by educational level and then create   
a table similar to the one shown below.

Although the average satisfaction for each group is

somewhat different and it appears that the mean satisfac-  
tion of individuals with a graduate degree is higher, we can-  
not tell conclusively whether or not these differences are   
significant because of sampling error.

Chapter 7

Statistical Inference

267

In statistical terminology, the variable of interest is called a

**factor**

. In this example,

the factor is the educational level, and we have three categorical levels of this factor, col-  
lege graduate, graduate degree, and some college. Thus, it would appear that we will have   
to perform three different pairwise tests to establish whether any significant differences   
exist among them. As the number of factor levels increases, you can easily see that the   
number of pairwise tests grows large very quickly.

Fortunately, other statistical tools exist that eliminate the need for such a tedious

approach.

**Analysis of variance (ANOVA)**

is one of them. Suppose we have

*m*

groups.

The null hypothesis for ANOVA is that the population means of all

*m*

groups are equal; the

alternative hypothesis is that at least one mean differs from the rest:

*H*

0

:

m

1

=

m

2

=

g

=

m

*m*

*H*

1

: at least one mean is different from the others

ANOVA derives its name from the fact that we are analyzing variances in the data;

essentially, ANOVA computes a measure of the variance between the means of each group   
and a measure of the variance within the groups and examines a test statistic that is the   
ratio of these measures. This test statistic can be shown to have an

*F*

-distribution (similar

to the test for equality of variances). If the

*F*

-statistic is large enough based on the level of

significance chosen and exceeds a critical value, we would reject the null hypothesis. Excel   
provides a

*Data Analysis*

tool,

*ANOVA: Single Factor*

, to conduct analysis of variance.

E X A M P L E 7 . 1 4

Applying the Excel ANOVA Tool

To test the null hypothesis that the mean satisfaction for   
all educational levels in the Excel file

*Insurance Survey*

are

equal against the alternative hypothesis that at least one   
mean is different, select

*ANOVA: Single Factor*

from the

*Data Analysis*

options. First, you must set up the work-

sheet so that the data you wish to use are displayed in   
contiguous columns, as shown in [Example 7.13.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#295) In the   
dialog shown in [Figure 7.14](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#296), specify the input range of the   
data (which must be in contiguous columns) and whether   
it is stored in rows or columns (that is, whether each   
factor level or group is a row or column in the range).   
The sample size for each factor level need not be the   
same, but the input range must be a rectangular region   
that contains all data. You must also specify the level of   
significance (

a

) .

The results for this example are given in [Figure 7.15.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#297)

The output report begins with a summary report of basic   
statistics for each group. The ANOVA section reports the   
details of the hypothesis test. You needn't worry about all   
the mathematical details. The important information to inter-  
pret the test is given in the columns labeled

*F*

(the

*F-*

test sta-

tistic),

*P-value*

(the

*p*

-value for the test), and

*F crit*

(the critical

value from the

*F*

-distribution). In this example,

*F*

=

3.92,

and the critical value from the

*F*

-distribution is 3.4668. Here

*F*

*F*

*crit*

; therefore, we must reject the null hypothesis and

conclude that there are significant differences in the means   
of the groups---that is, the mean satisfaction is not the same   
among the three educational levels. Alternatively, we see   
that the

*p*

-value is smaller than the chosen level of signifi-

cance, 0.05, leading to the same conclusion.

Chapter 7

Statistical Inference

Although ANOVA can identify a difference among the means of multiple populations,

it cannot determine which means are different from the rest. To do this, we may use the   
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison procedure. Unfortunately, Excel does not provide this   
tool, but it may be found in other statistical software.

[Assumptions of ANOVA](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#11)

ANOVA requires assumptions that the

*m*

groups or factor levels being studied represent

populations whose outcome measures

**1.**

are randomly and independently obtained,

**2.**

are normally distributed, and

**3.**

have equal variances.

If these assumptions are violated, then the level of significance and the power of the test

can be affected. Usually, the first assumption is easily validated when random samples are   
chosen for the data. ANOVA is fairly robust to departures from normality, so in most cases   
this isn't a serious issue. If sample sizes are equal, violation of the third assumption does not   
have serious effects on the statistical conclusions; however, with unequal sample sizes, it can.

When the assumptions underlying ANOVA are violated, you may use a

*nonparamet-*

*ric test*

that does not require these assumptions; we refer you to more comprehensive texts

on statistics for further information and examples.

Finally, we wish to point out that students often use ANOVA to compare the equality

of means of exactly two populations. It is important to realize that by doing this, you are   
making the assumption that the populations

*have equal variances*

(assumption 3). Thus,

you will find that the

*p*

-values for both ANOVA and the

*t*

-

*Test*

:

*Two-Sample Assuming*

*Equal Variances*

will be the same and lead to the same conclusion. However, if the vari-

ances are unequal, as is generally the case with sample data, ANOVA may lead to an erro-  
neous conclusion. We recommend that you do not use ANOVA for comparing the means   
of two populations, but instead use the appropriate

*t*

-test that assumes unequal variances.

A common problem in business is to determine whether two categorical variables are   
independent. We introduced the concept of independent events in [Chapter 5](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202). In the   
energy drink survey example ([Example 5.11](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#209)), we used conditional probabilities to deter-  
mine whether brand preference was independent of gender. However, with sample data,   
sampling error can make it difficult to properly assess the independence of categorical   
variables. We would never expect the joint probabilities to be exactly the same as the   
product of the marginal probabilities because of sampling error even if the two vari-  
ables are statistically independent. Testing for independence is important in marketing   
applications.

) and the cross-tabulation of the

results. A key marketing question is whether the proportion

of males who prefer a particular brand is no different from

the proportion of females. For instance, of the 63 males,

25 (40%) prefer brand 1. If gender and brand preference are

indeed independent, we would expect that about the same

proportion of the sample of females would also prefer brand

1. In actuality, only 9 of 37 (24%) prefer brand 1. Similarly,

27% of males prefer brand 2 versus 16% of females; and

33% of males prefer brand 3 versus 59% of females.

However, we do not know whether these differences are

simply due to sampling error or represent a significant dif-

ference. Knowing whether gender and brand preference

are independent can help marketing personnel better tar-

get advertising campaigns. If they are not independent,

then advertising should be targeted differently to males

and females, whereas if they are independent, it would not

matter.

We can test for independence by using a hypothesis test called the

The chi-square test for independence tests the following hypotheses:

*H*

0

: the two categorical variables are independent

*H*

: the two categorical variables are dependent

The chi-square test is an example of a

*nonparametric test*

, that is, one that does not

depend on restrictive statistical assumptions, as ANOVA does. This makes it a widely   
applicable and popular tool for understanding relationships among categorical data.   
The first step in the procedure is to compute the expected frequency in each cell of  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive299.png)

**chi-square statistic**

, which is the sum of

the squares of the differences between observed frequency,

First, when using PivotTables to construct a cross-tabulation and implement the chi-square   
test in Excel similar [to Figure 7.17,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#299)be extremely cautious of blank cells in the PivotTable.   
Blank cells will not be counted in the chi-square calculations and will lead to errors. If   
you have blank cells in the PivotTable, simply replace them with zeros, or right click in   
the PivotTable, choose

, and enter 0 in the field for the checkbox

.

Second, the chi-square test assumes adequate expected cell frequencies. A rule of

thumb is that there be no more than 20% of cells with expected frequencies smaller than 5,   
and no expected frequencies of zero. More advanced statistical procedures exist to handle   
this, but you might consider aggregating some of the rows or columns in a logical fashion

Conducting the Chi-Square Test for Independence

For the

*Energy Drink Survey*

data,[Figure 7.18](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#300) shows the

calculations of the chi-square statistic using[formula (7.8)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#299).   
For example, the formula in cell F17 is

=

(F5

-

F11)\^2

\>

F11,

which can be copied to the other cells. The grand total in the   
lower right cell is the value of

x

2

. In this case, the chi-square

test statistic is 6.4924. Since the cross-tabulation has

*r*

=

2

rows and

*c*

=

3 columns, we have (2

-

1) (3

-

=

2

degrees of freedom for the chi-square distribution. Using

a

=

0.05, the Excel function CHISQ.INV.RT(0.05, 2) returns

the critical value 5.99146. Because the test statistic exceeds   
the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis that the two   
categorical variables are independent.

Alternatively, we could simply use the CHISQ.TEST

function to find the

*p*

-value for the test and base our

conclusion on that without computing the chi-square sta-  
tistic. For this example, the function CHISQ.TEST(F5:H6,   
F11:H12) returns the

*p*

-value of 0.0389, which is less than

a

=

0.05; therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that brand

and gender are independent. Because a higher propor-  
tion of females prefer brand 3 while a higher proportion of   
males prefer brand 1, marketers might advertise brand 3 in   
female-related media, while brand 1 should receive higher   
emphasis in male-related media.

In [Chapter 5, we introduced the chi-square goodness of f](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)it test to determine whether data   
can be reasonably assumed to come from a specified distribution like the normal or expo-  
nential distribution. What we actually did was to conduct a hypothesis test:

*H*

0

: data are sampled from a specified distribution

*H*

1

: data are not sampled from the specified distribution

You can see the similarity to the chi-square test for independence in how the actual

and expected frequencies are used to calculate the chi-square statistic. If the chi-square   
statistic is larger than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, fail to reject   
it and conclude that the specified distribution is a reasonable model for the sample data.   
The key difference is how we used the hypothesized probability distribution to compute   
the expected frequencies.

Expected frequencies

The expected frequencies are shown next.

If we were to conduct a chi-square test of independence, we would see that of the 16 cells, five, or over 30%, have frequen-  
cies smaller than 5. Four of them are in the Cappuccino, Latte, and Mocha columns; these can be aggregated into one col-  
umn called Hot Specialty beverages.

Now only 2 of 12 cells have an expected frequency less than 5; this now meets the assumptions of the chi-square test.

to enforce this assumption, as the Example 7.18 illustrates. This, of course, results in fewer   
rows or columns, which changes the number of degrees of freedom.

Schlumberger is an international oilfield-services provider   
headquartered in Houston, Texas. Through an outsourc-  
ing contract, they supply help desk services for a global   
telecom company that offers wireline communications and   
integrated telecom services to more than 2 million cellu-  
lar subscribers. The help desk, located in Ecuador, faced   
increasing customer complaints and losses in dollars   
and cycle times. The company drew upon the analytics   
capability of one of the help desk managers to investigate   
and solve the problem. The data showed that the aver-  
age solution time for issues reported to the help desk   
was 9.75 hours. The company set a goal to reduce the   
average solution time by 50%. In addition, the number of   
issues reported to the help desk had reached an average   
of 30,000 per month. Reducing the total number of issues   
reported to the help desk would allow the company to   
address those issues that hadn't been resolved because   
of a lack of time, and to reduce the number of abandoned   
calls. They set a goal to identify preventable issues so that   
customers would not have to contact the help desk in the   
first place, and set a target of 15,000 issues.

As part of their analysis, they observed that the aver-

age solution time for help desk technicians working at   
the call center seemed to be lower than the average for   
technicians working on site with clients. They conducted   
a hypothesis test structured around the question: Is there   
a difference between having help desk employees work-  
ing at an off-site facility rather than on site within the cli-  
ent's main office? The null hypothesis was that there was   
no significant difference; the alternative hypothesis was

-test to assess whether the call center and the help desk are

statistically different from each other, they found no statisti-  
cally significant advantage in keeping help desk employees   
working at the call center. As a result, they moved help desk   
agents to the client's main office area. Using a variety of other   
analytical techniques, they were able to make changes to   
their process, resulting in the following:

■

a decrease in the number of help desk issues of 32%

■

improved capability to meet the target of 15,000 total   
issues

■

a reduction in the average desktop solution time from 9.75   
hours to 1 hour, an improvement of 89.7%

■

a reduction in the call-abandonment rate from 44% to   
26%

■

a reduction of 69% in help desk operating costs

$5.00 to $7.36 and has a known standard deviation   
of $2.11. A sample of 23 students in an online course   
that includes students across the country stated that   
their average price is $5.75. The students have also   
stated that they are generally unwilling to pay more   
than $6.50 for this meal. Formulate and conduct a

the population mean is less than $6.50.

A business school has a goal that the average number   
of years of work experience of its MBA applicants is   
more than three years. Historical data suggest that   
the variance has been constant at around six months,   
and thus, the population variance can be assumed

to be known. Based on last year's applicants, it   
was found that among a sample of 47, the average   
number of years of work experience is 3.1. Can the

support the poll results? Formulate the appropriate   
hypothesis test and draw a conclusion.

A bank found that in recent years, the average   
monthly charge on its credit card was $1,350. With   
an improving economy, they suspect that this amount   
has increased. A sample of 42 customers resulted in   
an average monthly charge of $1,376.54 with a stan-

increased? Formulate the appropriate hypothesis test

Formulate a hypothesis test to determine if the   
mean spending in these categories has statisti-  
cally increased.

b.

After the new advertising campaign was launched,   
a marketing study found that the mean spend-  
ing for 300 respondents in the 18--34 age group   
was $75.86, with a standard deviation of $50.90.   
Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the   
advertising strategy significantly increased sales   
in this age group?

c.

The marketing study also determined that for   
700 respondents in the 35

+

age group, the mean

and standard deviation were $68.53 and $45.29,   
respectively. Is there sufficient evidence to con-  
clude that the advertising strategy significantly   
increased sales in this age group?

14.

A university believes that the average retirement age   
among their faculty is now 70 instead of the histori-  
cal value of 65. A sample of 85 faculty found that the   
average of their expected retirement age is 68.4 with   
a standard deviation of 3.6. Is the university's belief   
valid?

15.

Call centers typically have high turnover. The director   
of human resources for a large bank has compiled data   
on about 70 former employees at one of the bank's   
call centers in the Excel file

*Call Center Data*

. In writ-

ing an article about call center working conditions, a   
reporter has claimed that the average tenure is no more   
than two years. Formulate and test a hypothesis using   
these data to determine if this claim can be disputed.

16.

Using the data in the Excel file

*Airport Service Times*

,

determine if the airline can claim that its average ser-  
vice time is less than 2.5 minutes.

17.

A computer repair firm believes that its average   
repair time is less than two weeks. Using the data in   
the Excel file

The State of Ohio Department of Education has a   
mandated ninth-grade proficiency test that covers

writing, reading, mathematics, citizenship (social   
studies), and science. The Excel file

*Ohio Educa-*

*tion Performance*

provides data on success rates

(defined as the percent of students passing) in school   
districts in the greater Cincinnati metropolitan area   
along with state averages. Test null hypotheses that   
the average scores in the Cincinnati area for each test   
and also for the composite score are equal to the state   
averages.

19.

Formulate and test hypotheses to determine if statisti-  
cal evidence suggests that the graduation rate for (1)   
top liberal arts colleges or (2) research universities   
in the Excel file

*Colleges and Universities*

exceeds

90%. Do the data support a conclusion that the grad-  
uation rates exceed 85%? Would your conclusions   
change if the level of significance was 0.01 instead of   
0.05?

20.

An industry trade publication stated that the average   
profit per customer for this industry was greater than   
$4,500. The Excel file

*Sales Data*

provides data on a

sample of customers. Using a test of hypothesis, do   
the data support this claim or not?

21.

A financial advisor believes that the proportion of   
investors who are risk-averse (that is, try to avoid risk   
in their investment decisions) is at least 0.7. A sur-  
vey of 32 investors found that 20 of them were risk-  
averse. Formulate a one-sample hypothesis test for a   
proportion to test this belief.

22.

The U.S. Department of Labor stated that the   
national unemployment rate was 4.9%. Of a sample   
of 90 people in one city, 5.2% were unemployed. Can   
the city conclude that their unemployment rate is the   
same as the national average?

23.

The Excel file

*Room Inspection*

provides data for

100 room inspections at each of 25 hotels in a major   
chain. Management would like the proportion of non-  
conforming rooms to be less than 2%. Formulate a   
one-sample hypothesis test for a proportion and per-  
form the calculations using the correct formulas and   
Excel functions, and compare your results with the

*One Sample Hypothesis Test*

Excel template to verify

them.

24.

An online bookseller is considering selling an   
e-reader but will do so only if they have evidence that   
the proportion of customers who will likely purchase   
one is more than 0.4. Of a survey of 25 customers,   
8 of them stated that they would likely purchase an   
e-reader. What should the bookseller do?

A producer of computer-aided design software for   
the aerospace industry receives numerous calls   
for technical support. Tracking software is used   
to monitor response and resolution times. In addi-  
tion, the company surveys customers who request   
support using the following scale: 0---did not meet   
expectations; 1---marginally met expectations;

2---met expectations; 3---exceeded expectations;   
4---greatly exceeded expectations. The questions   
are as follows:

Q1: Did the support representative explain the pro-

cess for resolving your problem?

Q2: Did the support representative keep you informed

about the status of progress in resolving your   
problem?

Q3: Was the support representative courteous and

professional?

Q4: Was your problem resolved?

Q5: Was your problem resolved in an acceptable

amount of time?

Q6: Overall, how did you find the service provided

by our technical support department?

A final question asks the customer to rate the overall

quality of the product using a scale of 0---very poor;   
1---poor; 2---good; 3---very good; 4---excellent.   
A sample of survey responses and associated resolu-  
tion and response data are provided in the Excel file

*Customer Support Survey*

.

a.

The company has set a service standard of one   
day for the mean resolution time. Does evidence   
exist that the resolution time is more than one   
day? How do the outliers in the data affect your   
result? What should you do about them?

b.

Test the hypothesis that the average service index   
is equal to the average engineer index.

The late management and quality guru Dr. W. Edwards Deming once stated that

all management is prediction. He was implying that when managers make deci-

sions, they must consider what will happen in the future. For example, financial

analysts cannot make good investment decisions without predicting the future

movement of stock prices, and airlines cannot determine when to purchase jet

fuel---and how much---without predicting how oil prices will change.

Trendlnes

show the movement of such attributes over time.

Many other applications of predictive analytics involve modeling relationships

between one or more independent variables and some dependent variable (called

regression analysis

). For example, we might wish to predict the level of sales based

on the price we set, or to predict sales based on the U.S. GDP (gross domestic

product) and the ten-year treasury bond rate to capture the influence of the business

cycle.

A marketing researcher might want to predict the intent of buying a particular

automobile model based on a survey that measures consumer attitudes toward the

brand, negative word of mouth, and income level.

An insurance company may

need to predict the number and amount of claims based on the demographics of its

customers. Human resource managers might need to predict the need for different

workforce skills in order to develop hiring and training plans. Fantasy sports hobby-

ists may want to predict the value of players based on various performance attri-

butes. Thus, you will likely find numerous opportunities to apply the tools we learn in

this chapter to your career and personal interests.

Trendlines and Regression Analysis

285

Trendlines and regression analysis are tools for building predictive models.

Our principal focus is to gain a basic understanding of how to use and interpret

trendlines and regression models, statistical issues associated with interpreting

regression analysis results, and practical issues in using trendlines and regression

as tools for making and evaluating decisions.

[Modeling Relationships and Trends in Data](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

Understanding both the mathematics and the descriptive properties of different functional   
relationships is important in building predictive analytical models. We often begin by cre-  
ating a chart of the data to understand them and choose the appropriate type of functional   
relationship to incorporate into an analytical model. For cross-sectional data, we use a   
scatter chart; for time-series data, we use a line chart.

Common types of mathematical functions used in predictive analytical models include

the following:

■

■

**Linear function:**

*y*

=

*a*

+

*bx*

. Linear functions show steady increases or

decreases over the range of

*x*

. This is the simplest type of function used in predic-

tive models. It is easy to understand and, over small ranges of values, can approx-  
imate behavior rather well.

■

■

**Logarithmic function:**

*y*

=

ln

1

*x*

2

. Logarithmic functions are used when the rate

of change in a variable increases or decreases quickly and then levels out, such as   
with diminishing returns to scale. Logarithmic functions are often used in mar-  
keting models where constant percentage increases in advertising, for instance,   
result in constant, absolute increases in sales.

■

■

**Polynomial function:**

*y*

=

*ax*

2

+

*bx*

+

*c*

(second order---quadratic func-

tion),

*y*

=

*ax*

3

+

*bx*

2

+

*cx*

+

*d*

(third order---cubic function), and so on. A

second-order polynomial is parabolic in nature and has only one hill or valley;   
a third-order polynomial has one or two hills or valleys. Revenue models that   
incorporate price elasticity are often polynomial functions.

■

■

**Power function:**

*y*

=

*ax*

*b*

. Power functions define phenomena that increase at a

specific rate. Learning curves that express improving times in performing a task   
are often modeled with power functions having

*a*

7

0 and

*b*

6

0.

■

■

**Exponential function:**

*y*

=

*ab*

*x*

. Exponential functions have the property that

*y*

rises or falls at constantly increasing rates. For example, the perceived brightness   
of a lightbulb grows at a decreasing rate as the wattage increases. In this case,

*a*

would be a positive number and

*b*

would be between 0 and 1. The exponential

function is often defined as

*y*

=

*ae*

*x*

, where

*b*

=

*e*

, the base of natural logarithms

(approximately 2.71828).

The Excel

*Trendline*

tool provides a convenient method for determining the best-fit-

ting functional relationship among these alternatives for a set of data. First, click the chart   
to which you wish to add a trendline; this will display the

*Chart Tools*

menu. Select the

*Chart Tools Design*

tab, and then click

*Add Chart Element*

from the

*Chart Layouts*

group.

From the

*Trendline*

submenu, you can select one of the options (

*Linear*

mon) or

*More Trendline Options*

. . . . If you select

*More Trendline Options*

, you will get

this is to right click on the data series in the chart and choose

, the better the fit. We will discuss this further

in the context of regression analysis.

Trendlines can be used to model relationships between variables and understand how

the dependent variable behaves as the independent variable changes. For example, the   
demand-prediction models that we introduced [in Chapter 1 (Examples 1.7 and 1.8) w](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30)ould   
generally be developed by analyzing data.

Price-Sales Data

). The relationship between price

and sales clearly appears to be linear, so a linear trendline   
was fit to the data. The resulting model is

Sales

=

20,512

-

9.5116

\*

Price

If the price is $125, we can estimate the the level of sales as

Sales

20,512

-

9.5116

125

=

19,323

This model can be used as the demand function in other   
marketing or financial analyses.

Trendlines are also used extensively in modeling trends over time---that is, when the

variable

*x*

in the functional relationships represents time. For example, an analyst for an

airline needs to predict where fuel prices are going, and an investment analyst would want   
to predict the price of stocks or key economic indicators.

Chapter 8

Trendlines and Regression Analysis

Be cautious when using polynomial functions. The

*R*

2

value will continue to increase as

the order of the polynomial increases; that is, a third-order polynomial will provide a better   
fit than a second-order polynomial, and so on. Higher-order polynomials will generally not   
be very smooth and will be difficult to interpret visually. Thus, we don't recommend going   
beyond a third-order polynomial when fitting data. Use your eye to make a good judgment!

Of course, the proper model to use depends on the scope of the data. As the chart in

[Figure 8.3 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#316)ws, crude oil prices were relatively stable until early 2007 and then began to   
increase rapidly. If the early data are included, the long-term functional relationship might   
not adequately express the short-term trend. For example, fitting a model to only the data   
beginning with January 2007 yields these models:

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

The difference in prediction can be significant. For example, predicting the price six

yields $172.25 for the third-order polynomial

fit with all the data and $246.45 for the exponential model with only the recent data. Thus,   
you must be careful to select the proper amount of data for the analysis. The question then   
becomes one of choosing the best assumptions for the model. Is it reasonable to assume   
that prices would increase exponentially, or perhaps at a slower rate, such as with the linear   
model fit? Or would they level off and start falling? Clearly, factors other than historical   
trends would enter into this choice. In the latter half of 2008, oil prices plunged; thus, all   
predictive models are risky.

**Regression analysis**

is a tool for building mathematical and statistical models that char-

acterize relationships between a dependent variable (which must be a ratio variable and   
not categorical) and one or more independent, or explanatory, variables, all of which are   
numerical (but may be either ratio or categorical).

Two broad categories of regression models are often used in business settings: (1)

regression models of cross-sectional data and (2) regression models of time-series data,   
in which the independent variables are time or some function of time and the focus is on   
predicting the future. Time-series regression is an important tool in

*forecasting*

, which is

[the subject of Chapter 9.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#354)

A regression model that involves a single independent variable is called

*simple regres-*

*sion*

. A regression model that involves two or more independent variables is called

*multiple*

*regression*

. In the remainder of this chapter, we describe how to develop and analyze both

simple and multiple regression models.

**Simple linear regression**

involves finding a linear relationship between one indepen-

dent variable,

*X*

, and one dependent variable,

*Y*

. The relationship between two variables can

assume many forms, as illustrated in [Figure 8.5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#319) The relationship may be linear or nonlinear,   
or there may be no relationship at all. Because we are focusing our discussion on linear regres-  
sion models, the first thing to do is to verify that the relationship is linear, as in [Figure 8.5(a).](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#319)   
We would not expect to see the data line up perfectly along a straight line; we simply want   
to verify that the general relationship is linear. If the relationship is clearly nonlinear, as in   
[Figure 8.5(b),](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#319) then alternative approaches must be used, and if no relationship is evident, as   
in[Figure 8.5(c),](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#319) then it is pointless to even consider developing a linear regression model.

Procter \& Gamble (P\&G) laundry products are global   
household brands that include Tide, Dash, and Gain and   
are offered in several physical product forms, including   
powders, liquids, pods, tablets, and bars. These prod-  
ucts are manufactured at more than 30 sites and sold in   
more than 150 countries worldwide. The design of laundry   
product formulations (that is, ingredient composition of   
chemical mixtures) has become more complex over the   
years because of challenges such as product-portfolio   
expansion, rapidly changing ingredient costs and avail-  
ability, and increasing competitive activity.

P\&G's research and development organization

is at the forefront of the development and adoption of   
modeling tools that enable the company to make bet-  
ter decisions on product formulation, processing, and   
manufacturing. These include empirical models that

predict chemical reactions during manufacturing, in-use   
physical properties of the product, technical performance   
of the product, and even consumer acceptance rates.   
These tools enable researchers to instantly predict a prod-  
uct's physical properties and performance, integrate mod-  
els, and balance production trade-offs using a variety of   
predictive and prescriptive capabilities. Predictive mod-  
els the company has used include third-order polynomial   
functions that capture the two performance qualities of a   
mixture: stain removal and whiteness. For example, stain

To determine if a linear relationship exists between the variables, we recommend that

you create a scatter chart that can show the relationship between variables visually.

The market value of a house is typically related to its size.   
In the Excel file

Home Market Value

(see[Figure 8.6)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#319), data

obtained from a county auditor provide information about   
the age, square footage, and current market value of houses   
in a particular subdivision. We might wish to investigate the   
relationship between the market value and the size of the   
home. The independent variable,

X

, is the number of square

feet, and the dependent variable,

Y

, is the market value.

[Figure 8.7 shows a scatter chart of the market value](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#319)

in relation to the size of the home. In general, we see that   
higher market values are associated with larger house sizes,   
and the relationship is approximately linear. Therefore, we   
could conclude that simple linear regression would be an   
appropriate technique for predicting market value based on   
house size.

some will fall below it, and a few might fall on the line itsel[f. Figure 8.8 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#321)ws two pos-  
sible straight lines that pass through the data. Clearly, you would choose A as the better-  
fitting line over B because all the points are closer to the line and the line appears to be in   
the middle of the data. The only difference between the lines is the value of the slope and   
intercept; thus, we seek to determine the values of the slope and intercept that provide the   
best-fitting line. We can find the best-fitting line using the Excel

*Trendline*

tool (with the

*Linear*

option chosen), as described earlier in this chapter.

Square Feet

The value of the regression line can be explained as

follows. Suppose we wanted to estimate the home market   
value for any home in the population from which the sample   
data were gathered. If all we knew were the market values,   
then the best estimate of the market value for any home   
would simply be the sample mean, which is $92,069. Thus,   
no matter if the house has 1,500 square feet or 2,200 square   
feet, the best estimate of market value would still be $92,069.   
Because the market values vary from about $75,000 to more   
than $120,000, there is quite a bit of uncertainty in using the

mean as the estimate. However, from the scatter chart, we   
see that larger homes tend to have higher market values.   
Therefore, if we know that a home has 2,200 square feet, we   
would expect the market value estimate to be higher than   
that for one that has only 1,500 square feet. For example,   
the estimated market value of a home with 2,200 square feet   
would be

market value as a function of the house size and   
provides better estimates than simply using the average

As we sa[w in Example 8.4, once we ha](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#320)ve determined the slope and intercept of the best-  
fitting line, we can simply substitute a value for the independent variable

*X*

in order to

predict the dependent variable

*Y*

. However, there is one important caution: It is danger-

ous to extrapolate a regression model outside the ranges covered by the observations. For   
instance, if you want to predict the market value of a house that has 3,000 square feet, the   
results may or may not be accurate because the regression model estimates did not use any   
observations greater than 2,400 square feet. We cannot be sure that a linear extrapolation   
will hold and should not use the model to make such predictions.

The mathematical basis for the best-fitting regression line is called

**least-squares regres-**

**sion**

. In regression analysis, we assume that the values of the dependent variable,

*Y*

, in the

sample data are drawn from some unknown population for each value of the independent   
variable,

*X*

. For example, in the

*Home Market Value*

data, the first and fourth observations

come from a population of homes having 1,812 square feet; the second observation comes   
from a population of homes having 1,914 square feet; and so on.

Because we are assuming that a linear relationship exists, the expected value of

*Y*

is

b

0

+

b

1

*X*

for each value of

*X*

. The coefficients

b

0

and

b

are population parameters that

represent the intercept and slope, respectively, of the population from which a sample of

observations is taken. The intercept is the mean value of

*Y*

when

*X*

=

0, and the slope is

the change in the mean value of

*Y*

as

*X*

changes by one unit.

Thus, for a specific value of

*X*

, we have many possible values of

*Y*

that vary around the

mean. To account for this, we add an error term,

e

(the Greek letter epsilon), to the mean.

This defines a simple linear regression model:

*Y*

=

b

0

+

b

1

*X*

+

e

**(8.1)**

However, because we don't know the entire population, we don't know the true values of

b

0

and

b

1

. In practice, we must estimate these as best we can from the sample data. Define

*b*

0

and

*b*

1

to be estimates of

b

0

and

b

1

. Thus, the estimated simple linear regression equation is

*Y*

n

=

*b*

0

+

*b*

*X*

**(8.2)**

Let

*X*

be the value of the independent variable of the

, then

=

*b*

*b*

*X*

*i*

is the estimated value of

*Y*

for

.

One way to quantify the relationship between each point and the estimated regression

equation is to measure the vertical distance between [them, as illustrated in Figure 8.10. W](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#322)e   
can think of these differences,

*e*

*i*

, as the observed errors (often called

**residuals**

) associated

with estimating the value of the dependent variable using the regression line. Thus, the   
error associated with the

*i*

th observation is

*e*

*i*

=

*Y*

*i*

-

*Y*

n

*i*

**(8.3)**

The best-fitting line should minimize some measure of these errors. Because some

errors will be negative and others positive, we might take their absolute value or simply   
square them. Mathematically, it is easier to work with the squares of the errors.

Adding the squares of the errors, we obtain the following function:

If we can find the best values of the slope and intercept that minimize the sum of squares   
(hence the name "least squares") of the observed errors

, we will have found the best-

fitting regression line. Note that

Chapter 8

Trendlines and Regression Analysis

Although the calculations for the least-squares coefficients appear to be somewhat

complicated, they can easily be performed on an Excel spreadsheet. Even better, Excel has   
built-in capabilities for doing this. For example, you may use the functions INTERCEPT   
(

*known_y's, known_x's*

) and SLOPE(

*known_y's, known_x's*

) to find the least-squares

coefficients

*b*

0

and

*b*

1

. We may use the Excel function TREND(

*known_y's, known_x's,*

*new_x's*

) to estimate

*Y*

for any value of

*X*

.

We could stop at this point, because we have found the best-fitting line for the observed

data. However, there is a lot more to regression analysis from a statistical perspective,   
because we are working with sample data---and usually rather small samples---which we   
know have a lot of variation as compared with the full population. Therefore, it is impor-  
tant to understand some of the statistical properties associated with regression analysis.

[Simple Linear Regression with Excel](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

Regression analysis software tools available in Excel provide a variety of information   
about the statistical properties of regression analysis. The Excel

*Regression*

tool can be

used for both simple and multiple linear regressions. For now, we focus on using the tool   
just for simple linear regression.

From the

*Data Analysis*

menu in the

*Analysis*

group under the

*Data*

tab, select the

*Regression*

tool. The dialog box shown in[Figure 8.11](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#323)is displayed. In the box for the

, specify the range of the dependent variable values. In the box for the

specify the range for the independent variable values. Check

tains a descriptive label (we highly recommend using this). You have the option of forcing the

intercept to zero by checking

*Constant is Zero*

; however, you will usually not check this box

because adding an intercept term allows a better fit to the data. You also can set a

*Confidence*

*Level*

(the default of 95% is commonly used) to provide confidence intervals for the intercept

and slope parameters. In the

*Residuals*

section, you have the option of including a residuals

output table by checking the boxes for

*Residuals*

,

*Standardized Residuals*

,

*Residual Plots*

,

and

*Line Fit Plots. Residual Plots*

generates a chart for each independent variable versus the

residual, and

*Line Fit Plots*

generates a scatter chart with the values predicted by the regres-

sion model included (however, creating a scatter chart with an added trendline is visually   
superior to what this tool provides). Finally, you may also choose to have Excel construct a   
normal probability plot for the dependent variable, which transforms the cumulative prob-  
ability scale (vertical axis) so that the graph of the cumulative normal distribution is a straight   
line. The closer the points are to a straight line, the better the fit to a normal distribution.

[Figure 8.12 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#324)ws the basic regression analysis output provided by the Excel

*Regres-*

*sion*

tool for the

*Home Market Value*

data. The output consists of three sections:

*Regres-*

*sion Statistics*

(rows 3--8),

*ANOVA*

(rows 10--14), and an unlabeled section at the bottom

(rows 16--18) with other statistical information. The least-squares estimates of the slope   
and intercept are found in the

*Coefficients*

column in the bottom section of the output.

In the

*Regression Statistics*

section,

*Multiple R*

is another name for the sample cor-

relation coefficient,

*r*

, which was introduced in [Chapter 4.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144) Values of

*r*

range from

-

1 to

1, where the sign is determined by the sign of the slope of the regression line. A

*Multiple*

*R*

value greater than 0 indicates positive correlation, that is, as the independent variable

increases, the dependent variable does also; a value less than 0 indicates negative correla-  
tion---as

*X*

increases,

*Y*

decreases. A value of 0 indicates no correlation.

*R Square*

*R*

2

is called the

**coefficient of determination**

. Earlier we noted that

*R*

2

is

a measure of how well the regression line fits the data; this value is also provided by the

*Trendline*

tool. Specifically,

*R*

2

gives the proportion of variation in the dependent variable

that is explained by the independent variable of the regression model. The value of

*R*

2

is

between 0 and 1. A value of 1.0 indicates a perfect fit, and all data points lie on the regres-  
sion line, whereas a value of 0 indicates that no relationship exists. Although we would like   
high values of

*R*

2

, it is difficult to specify a "good" value that signifies a strong relation-

ship because this depends on the application. For example, in scientific applications such   
as calibrating physical measurement equipment,

*R*

2

values close to 1 would be expected.

In marketing research studies, an

*R*

2

of 0.6 or more is considered very good; however, in

many social science applications, values in the neighborhood of 0.3 might be considered   
acceptable.

comparing this model with other models that include additional explanatory variables. We   
discuss it more fully in the context of multiple linear regression later in this chapter.

-

). Therefore, assuming a

level of significance of 0.05, we must reject the null hypoth-  
esis and conclude that the slope---the coefficient for square   
feet---is not zero. This means that home size is a statisti-  
cally significant variable in explaining the variation in market   
value.

EXAMPLE

8.6

Interpreting Regression Statistics for Simple Linear Regression

After running the Excel

Regression

tool, the first things to

look for are the values of the slope and intercept, namely,   
the estimates

b

1

and

b

0

in the regression model. In the

Home Market Value

example, we see that the intercept is

32,673, and the slope (coefficient of the independent vari-  
able, square feet) is 35.036, just as we had computed ear-  
lier. In the

Regression Statistics

section,

R

2

=

0.5347. This

means that approximately 53% of the variation in market

value is explained by square feet. The remaining variation   
is due to other factors that were not included in the model.   
The standard error of the estimate is $7,287.72. If we com-  
pare this to the standard deviation of the market value, which   
is $10,553, we see that the variation around the regression   
line ($7,287.72) is

less

than the variation around the sample

mean ($10,553). This is because the independent variable in   
the regression model explains some of the variation.

[Regression as Analysis of Variance](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

In [Chapter 7,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#276) we introduced analysis of variance (ANOVA), which conducts an

*F*

-test

to determine whether variation due to a particular factor, such as the differences in sam-  
ple means, is significantly greater than that due to error. ANOVA is commonly applied   
to regression to test for

*significance of regression*

. For a simple linear regression model,

**significance of regression**

is simply a hypothesis test of whether the regression coefficient

**(8.7)**

If we reject the null hypothesis, then we may conclude that the slope of the independent   
variable is not zero and, therefore, is statistically significant in the sense that it explains   
some of the variation of the dependent variable around the mean. Similar to our discussion   
in [Chapter 7,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#276) you needn't worry about the mathematical details of how

*F*

is computed, or

even its value, especially since the tool does not provide the critical value for the test. What   
is important is the value of

*Significance F*

, which is the

*p*

-value for the

*F*

-test. If

*Significance*

*F*

is less than the level of significance (typically 0.05), we would reject the null hypothesis.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive326.png)

Rows 17--18 of the Excel output, in addition to specifying the least-squares coefficients,   
provide additional information for testing hypotheses associated with the intercept and   
slope. Specifically, we may test the null hypothesis that

b

0

or

b

1

equals zero. Usually, it

makes little sense to test or interpret the hypothesis that

b

0

=

0 unless the intercept has a

significant physical meaning in the context of the application. For simple linear regression,   
testing the null hypothesis

*H*

0

:

b

1

=

0 is the same as the significance of regression test that

we described earlier.

The

*t*

-test for the slope is similar to the one-sample test for the mean that we described

[in Chapter 7.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#276)The test statistic is

Standard Error

**(8.8)**

and is given in the column labeled

in the Excel output. Although the critical value of

the

-value for the test.

EXAMPLE

8.8

Interpreting Hypothesis Tests for Regression Coefficients

For the

Home Market Value

example, note that the value of

t

Stat

is computed by dividing the coefficient by the standard

[error using formula (8.8). For instance,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#326)

t Stat

for the slope

is 35.03637258

\>

5.16738385

=

6.780292232. Because

Excel does not provide the critical value with which to   
compare the

t Stat

value, we may use the

p

-value to draw a

conclusion. Because the

p

-values for both coefficients are

essentially zero, we would conclude that neither coefficient   
is statistically equal to zero. Note that the

p

-value associ-

ated with the test for the slope coefficient, square feet, is   
equal to the

Significance F

value. This will always be true for

a regression model with one independent variable because   
it is the only explanatory variable. However, as we shall see,   
this will not be the case for multiple regression models.

[Confidence Intervals for Regression Coefficients](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

Confidence intervals (

*Lower 95%*

and

*Upper 95%*

values in the output) provide informa-

tion about the unknown values of the true regression coefficients, accounting for sampling   
error. They tell us what we can reasonably expect to be the ranges for the population inter-  
cept and slope at a 95% confidence level. By using the confidence interval limits for the   
model parameters, we can determine how estimates using the model might vary.

We may also use confidence intervals to test hypotheses about the regression coeffi-

cients. For example, [in Figure 8.12, we](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#324)see that neither confidence interval includes zero;   
therefore, we can conclude that

b

0

and

b

1

are statistically different from zero. Similarly, we

can use them to test the hypotheses that the regression coefficients equal some value other   
than zero. For example, to test the hypotheses

Recall that residuals are the observed errors, which are the differences between the actual   
values and the estimated values of the dependent variable using the regression equation.

**Standard residuals**

are residuals divided by their standard deviation. Standard residu-

als describe how far each residual is from its mean in units of standard deviations (similar   
to a

*z*

-value for a standard normal distribution). Standard residuals are useful in checking

assumptions underlying regression analysis, which we will address shortly, and to detect   
outliers that may bias the results. Recall that an outlier is an extreme value that is different   
from the rest of the data. A single outlier can make a significant difference in the regression

equation, changing the slope and intercept and, hence, how they would be interpreted and   
used in practice. Some consider a standardized residual outside of

a

3 standard deviation range. (Commercial software packages have more sophisticated

techniques for identifying outliers.)

Interpreting Residual Output

For the

data, the first observa-

tion has a market value of $90,000 and the regres-  
sion model predicts $96,159.13. Thus, the residual is   
90,000

96,159.13

=

$

6,159.13. The standard devia-

tion of the residuals can be computed as 7,198.299. By   
dividing the residual by this value, we have the stan-  
dardized residual for the first observation. The value of

-

0.8556 tells us that the first observation is about 0.85

standard deviation below the regression line. If we check   
the values of all the standardized residuals, you will find   
that the value of the last data point is 4.53, meaning that   
the market value of this home, having only 1,581 square

feet, is more than 4 standard deviations above the pre-  
dicted value and would clearly be identified as an outlier.   
(If you look back at [Figure 8.7,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#319) you may have noticed that   
this point appears to be quite different from the rest of   
the data.) You might question whether this observation   
belongs in the data, because the house has a large value   
despite a relatively small size. The explanation might be an   
outdoor pool or an unusually large plot of land. Because   
this value will influence the regression results and may not   
be representative of the other homes in the neighborhood,   
you might consider dropping this observation and recom-  
puting the regression model.

[Checking Assumptions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

The statistical hypothesis tests associated with regression analysis are predicated on some   
key assumptions about the data.

**1.**

*Linearity.*

This is usually checked by examining a scatter diagram of the data

or examining the residual plot. If the model is appropriate, then the residuals   
should appear to be randomly scattered about zero, with no apparent pattern.   
If the residuals exhibit some well-defined pattern, such as a linear trend or a   
parabolic shape, then there is good evidence that some other functional form   
might better fit the data.

Chapter 8

Trendlines and Regression Analysis

**2.**

*Normality of errors.*

Regression analysis assumes that the errors for each indi-

vidual value of

*X*

are normally distributed, with a mean of zero. This can be

verified either by examining a histogram of the standard residuals and inspect-  
ing for a bell-shaped distribution or by using more formal goodness of fit tests.   
It is usually difficult to evaluate normality with small sample sizes. However,   
regression analysis is fairly robust against departures from normality, so in most   
cases, this is not a serious issue.

**3.**

*Homoscedasticity.*

The third assumption is

**homoscedasticity**

, which means

that the variation about the regression line is constant for all values of the inde-  
pendent variable. This can also be evaluated by examining the residual plot and   
looking for large differences in the variances at different values of the indepen-  
dent variable. Caution should be exercised when looking at residual plots. In   
many applications, the model is derived from limited data, and multiple obser-  
vations for different values of

*X*

are not available, making it difficult to draw

definitive conclusions about homoscedasticity. If this assumption is seriously   
violated, then techniques other than least squares should be used for estimating   
the regression model.

**4.**

*Independence of errors.*

Finally, residuals should be independent for each value

of the independent variable. For cross-sectional data, this assumption is usu-  
ally not a problem. However, when time is the independent variable, this is an   
important assumption. If successive observations appear to be correlated---for   
example, by becoming larger over time or exhibiting a cyclical type of pat-  
tern---then this assumption is violated. Correlation among successive obser-  
vations over time is called

**autocorrelation**

and can be identified by residual

plots having clusters of residuals with the same sign. Autocorrelation can be   
evaluated more formally using a statistical test based on a measure called the   
Durbin--Watson statistic. The Durbin--Watson statistic is

**(8.9)**

This is a ratio of the squared differences in successive residuals to the sum of   
the squares of all residuals.

*D*

will range from 0 to 4. When successive residuals

are positively autocorrelated,

*D*

will approach 0. Critical values of the statistic

have been tabulated based on the sample size and number of independent vari-  
ables that allow you to conclude that there is either evidence of autocorrelation   
or no evidence of autocorrelation or the test is inconclusive. For most practical   
purposes, values below 1 suggest autocorrelation; values above 1.5 and below   
2.5 suggest no autocorrelation; and values above 2.5 suggest negative autocor-  
relation. This can become an issue when using regression in forecasting, which   
we discuss in the next chapter. Some software packages compute this statistic;   
however, Excel does not.

When assumptions of regression are violated, statistical inferences drawn from the

hypothesis tests may not be valid. Thus, before drawing inferences about regression mod-  
els and performing hypothesis tests, these assumptions should be checked. However, other   
than linearity, these assumptions are not needed solely for model fitting and estimation   
purposes.

dict the graduation rate as a function of the other variables---median SAT, acceptance rate,

propose that schools with students who have higher SAT scores, a lower acceptance rate,   
a larger budget, and a higher percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school   
classes will tend to retain and graduate more students.

Chapter 8

Trendlines and Regression Analysis

A linear regression model with more than one independent variable is called a

**mul-**

**tiple linear regression**

model. Simple linear regression is just a special case of multiple

linear regression. A multiple linear regression model has the form

are the independent (explanatory) variables,

ables, and

to predict the value of the dependent variable. The partial regression coefficients repre-  
sent the expected change in the dependent variable when the associated independent vari-  
able is increased by one unit

*while the values of all other independent variables are held*

*constant*

.

For the college and university data, the proposed model would be

Thus,

*b*

would represent an estimate of the change in the graduation rate for a unit increase

in the acceptance rate while holding all other variables constant.

As with simple linear regression, multiple linear regression uses least squares to esti-

mate the intercept and slope coefficients that minimize the sum of squared error terms   
over all observations. The principal assumptions discussed for simple linear regression   
also hold here. The Excel

*Regression*

tool can easily perform multiple linear regression;

you need to specify only the full range for the independent variable data in the dialog. One   
caution when using the tool:

*The independent variables in the spreadsheet must be in con-*

*tiguous columns*

. So you may have to manually move the columns of data around before

applying the tool.

The results from the

*Regression*

tool are in the same format as we saw for simple lin-

ear regression. However, some key differences exist.

*Multiple R*

and

*R Square*

(or

*R*

2

) are

called the

**multiple correlation coefficient**

and the

**coefficient of multiple determination**

,

respectively, in the context of multiple regression. They indicate the strength of association   
between the dependent and independent variables. Similar to simple linear regression,

*R*

2

explains the percentage of variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the set of   
independent variables in the model.

The interpretation of the ANOVA section is quite different from that in simple lin-

ear regression. For multiple linear regression, ANOVA tests for significance of the

The null hypothesis states that no linear relationship exists between the dependent

and

*any*

of the independent variables, whereas the alternative hypothesis states that the

dependent variable has a linear relationship with

*at least*

one independent variable. If the

null hypothesis is rejected, we cannot conclude that a relationship exists with every inde-  
pendent variable individually.

The multiple linear regression output also provides information to test hypotheses

about

*each*

of the individual regression coefficients. Specifically, we may test the null

hypothesis that

b

0

(the intercept) or any

b

*i*

equals zero. If we reject the null hypothesis that

the slope associated with independent variable

*i*

is zero,

*H*

0

:

b

*i*

=

0, then we may state that

independent variable

*i*

is

*significant*

in the regression model; that is, it contributes to reduc-

ing the variation in the dependent variable and improves the ability of the model to better   
predict the dependent variable. However, if we cannot reject

*H*

0

, then that independent

variable is not significant and probably should not be included in the model. We see how to   
use this information to identify the best model in the next section.

Finally, for multiple regression models, a residual plot is generated for each indepen-

dent variable. This allows you to assess the linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions of   
regression.

Interpreting Regression Results for the

Data

The multiple regression results for the college and university   
[data are shown in Figure 8.17.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#333)

The signs of some coefficients make sense; higher SAT

scores and lower acceptance rates suggest higher gradu-  
ation rates. However, we might expect that larger student   
expenditures and a higher percentage of top high school   
students would also positively influence the graduation rate.   
Perhaps the problem occurred because some of the best   
students are more demanding and change schools if their   
needs are not being met, some entrepreneurial students   
might pursue other interests before graduation, or there is   
sampling error. As with simple linear regression, the model   
should be used only for values of the independent variables   
within the range of the data.

The value of

R

2

(0.53) indicates that 53% of the

variation in the dependent variable is explained by these

independent variables. This suggests that other factors not   
included in the model, perhaps campus living conditions,   
social opportunities, and so on, might also influence the   
graduation rate.

From the

ANOVA

section, we may test for significance

of regression. At a 5% significance level, we reject the   
null hypothesis because

Significance F

is essentially zero.

Therefore, we may conclude that at least one slope is sta-  
tistically different from zero.

Looking at the

p

-values for the independent variables

in the last section, we see that all are less than 0.05; there-  
fore, we reject the null hypothesis that each partial regres-  
sion coefficient is zero and conclude that each of them is   
statistically significant.

Aramark's Global Risk Management Department (GRM)

needed a way to determine the statistical relationships   
between key business metrics (for example, employee ten-  
ure, employee engagement, a trained workforce, account   
tenure, service offerings) and risk metrics (for example,   
OSHA rate, workers' compensation rate, customer injuries)   
to understand the impact of these risks on the business.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive334.png)

GRM also needed a simple tool that field operators and

the risk management team could use to predict the impact

of business decisions on risk metrics before those deci-

sions were implemented. Typical questions they would

want to ask were, What would happen to our OSHA rate if

we increased the percentage of part time labor? and How

could we impact turnover if operations improved safety

performance?

Aramark maintains extensive historical data. For

example, the GRM group keeps track of data such as

OSHA rates, slip/trip/fall rates, injury costs, and level of

compliance with safety standards; the Human Resources

department monitors turnover and percentage of part-

time labor; the Payroll Department keeps data on average

wages; and the Training and Organizational Development

Department collects data on employee engagement.

Excel-based linear regression was used to determine the

relationships between the dependent variables (such as

OSHA rate, slip/trip/fall rate, claim cost, and turnover) and

the independent variables (such as the percentage of part-

time labor, average wage, employee engagement, and

safety compliance).

Although the regression models provided the basic

analytical support that Aramark needed, the GRM team

used a novel approach to implement the models for use by

their clients. They developed "interactive risk simulators,"

which are simple online tools that allowed users to manipu-

late the values of the independent variables in the regres-

sion models using interactive sliders that correspond to the

business metrics and instantaneously view the values of the

dependent variables (the risk metrics) on gauges similar to

those found on the dashboard of a car.

[Figure 8.19](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#334)illustrates the structure of the simulators.

The gauges are updated instantly as the user adjusts the

sliders, showing how changes in the business environment

affect the risk metrics. This visual representation made the

models easy to use and understand, particularly for non-

technical employees.

GRM sent out more than 200 surveys to multiple levels

of the organization to assess the usefulness of the interac-

tive risk simulators. One hundred percent of respondents

answered "Yes" to "Were the simulators easy to use?" and

78% of respondents answered "Yes" to "Would these sim-

ulators be useful in running your business and helping you

make decisions?" The deployment of interactive risk simu-

lators to the field has been met with overwhelming positive

response and recognition from leadership within all lines of

business, including frontline managers, food-service direc-

tors, district managers, and general managers.

In the colleges and universities regression example, all the independent variables were   
found to be significant by evaluating the

*p*

-values of the regression analysis. This will not

more than 94% of the variation in the average bank balance, you can see that at a 0.05   
significance level, the

*p*

-values indicate that both education and home value do not appear

to be significant. A good regression model should include only significant independent   
variables. However, it is not always clear exactly what will happen when we add or remove   
variables from a model; variables that are (or are not) significant in one model may (or may   
not) be significant in another. Therefore, you should

*not*

consider dropping all insignificant

variables at one time, but rather take a more structured approach.

This suggests a systematic approach to building good regression models:

**1.**

Construct a model with all available independent variables. Check for signifi-  
cance of the independent variables by examining the

*p*

-values.

**2.**

Identify the independent variable having the largest

*p*

-value that exceeds the

chosen level of significance.

**3.**

Remove the variable identified in step 2 from the model. (Don't remove all   
variables with

*p*

-values that exceed

a

at the same time, but remove only one at

a time.)

**4.**

Continue until all variables are significant.

In essence, this approach seeks to find a model that has only significant independent   
variables.

Identifying the Best Regression Model

We will apply the preceding approach to the

example. The first step is to identify the variable with the   
largest

p

-value exceeding 0.05; in this case, it is home

value, and we remove it from the model and rerun the

ing home value. All the

p

-values are now less than 0.05,

so this now appears to be the best model. Notice that the

p

-value for education, which was larger than 0.05 in the first

regression analysis, dropped below 0.05 after home value   
was removed. This phenomenon often occurs when mul-  
ticollinearity (discussed in the next section) is present and   
emphasizes the importance of not removing all variables   
with large

p

-values from the original model at the same

time.

Chapter 8

Trendlines and Regression Analysis

Adding an independent variable to a regression model will

*always*

result in

*R*

2

equal

to or greater than the

*R*

2

of the original model. This is true even when the new independent

variable has little true relationship with the dependent variable. Thus, trying to maximize

*R*

2

is not a useful criterion. A better way of evaluating the relative fit of different models

is to use adjusted

*R*

2

. Adjusted

*R*

2

reflects both the number of independent variables and

the sample size and may either increase or decrease when an independent variable is added   
or dropped, thus providing an indication of the value of adding or removing independent   
variables in the model. An increase in adjusted

*R*

2

indicates that the model has improved.

A criterion used to determine if a variable should be removed based on the adjusted

*R*

2

is the

*t*

-statistic. If

0

*t*

0

6

1, then the standard error will decrease and adjusted

*R*

2

will

increase if the variable is removed. If

0

*t*

0

7

1, then the opposite will occur. In the bank-

ing regression results, we see that the

*t*

-statistic for home value is less than 1; therefore,

we expect the adjusted

*R*

2

to increase if we remove this variable. You can follow the same

iterative approach outlined before, except using

*t*

-values instead of

*p*

-values. One might,

for example, choose the smallest

∙

*t*

∙

at each step. This approach will improve the adjusted

*R*

2

but may result in a model with insignificant independent variables.

These approaches using the

*p*

-values or

*t*

-statistics may involve considerable experi-

mentation to identify the best set of variables that result in the largest adjusted

*R*

2

. For large

numbers of independent variables, the number of potential models can be overwhelming.   
For example, there are 2

10

=

1,024 possible models that can be developed from a set of

ten independent variables. This can make it difficult to effectively screen out insignificant   
variables. Fortunately, automated methods---stepwise regression and best subsets---exist   
that facilitate this process.

As we have learned previously, correlation, a numerical value between

-

1 and

+

1, mea-

sures the linear relationship between pairs of variables. The higher the absolute value of the   
correlation, the greater the strength of the relationship. The sign simply indicates whether   
variables tend to increase together (positive) or not (negative). Therefore, examining cor-  
relations between the dependent and independent variables, which can be done using the   
Excel

*Correlation*

tool, can be useful in selecting variables to include in a multiple regres-

sion model because a strong correlation indicates a strong linear relationship. However,   
strong correlations

*among the independent variables*

can be problematic. This can poten-

tially signify a phenomenon called

**multicollinearity**

, a condition occurring when two or

more independent variables in the same regression model contain high levels of the same   
information and, consequently, are strongly correlated with one another and can predict   
each other better than the dependent variable. When significant multicollinearity is present,   
it becomes difficult to isolate the effect of one independent variable on the dependent vari-  
able, and the signs of coefficients may be the opposite of what they should be, making it   
difficult to interpret regression coefficients. Also,

*p*

-values can be inflated, resulting in the

conclusion not to reject the null hypothesis for significance of regression when it should   
be rejected.

Some experts suggest that correlations between independent variables exceeding an

absolute value of 0.7 may indicate multicollinearity. However, multicollinearity is best   
measured using a statistic called the

*variance inflation factor (VIF)*

for each independent

variable. Sophisticated software packages usually compute these; unfortunately, Excel   
does not.

SAT and acceptance rate have moderate correlations   
with the dependent variable, graduation %, but the cor-  
relation between expenditures/student and top 10% HS   
with graduation % are relatively low. The strongest cor-  
relation, however, is between two independent variables:   
top 10% HS and acceptance rate. However, the value of

-

0.6097 does not exceed the recommended threshold of

0.7, so we can likely assume that multicollinearity is not   
a problem here (a more advanced analysis using VIF cal-  
culations does indeed confirm that multicollinearity does   
not exist).

In contrast, [Figure 8.24](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#338)shows the correlation matrix

for all the data in the banking example. Note that large cor-  
relations exist between education and home value and also   
between wealth and income (in fact, the variance inflation   
factors do indicate significant multicollinearity). If we remove   
wealth from the model, the adjusted

R

2

drops to 0.9201, but

we discover that education is no longer significant. Dropping   
education and leaving only age and income in the model   
results in an adjusted

R

2

of 0.9202. However, if we remove

income from the model instead of wealth, the adjusted

R

2

drops to only 0.9345, and all remaining variables (age, edu-  
cation, and wealth) are significant (see [Figure 8.25](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#338)). The

value for the model with these three variables is 0.9365.

Finding a good regression model often requires some experimentation and trial and error.   
From a practical perspective, the independent variables selected should make some sense   
in attempting to explain the dependent variable (that is, you should have some reason to   
believe that changes in the independent variable will cause changes in the dependent vari-  
able even though causation cannot be proven statistically). Logic should guide your model   
development. In many applications, behavioral, economic, or physical theory might sug-  
gest that certain variables should belong in a model. Remember that additional variables do   
contribute to a higher

*R*

2

and, therefore, help to explain a larger proportion of the variation.

Even though a variable with a large

*p*

-value is not statistically significant, it could simply

be the result of sampling error and a modeler might wish to keep it.

Good modelers also try to have as simple a model as possible---an age-old principle

known as

**parsimony**

---with the fewest number of explanatory variables that will provide

an adequate interpretation of the dependent variable. In the physical and management sci-  
ences, some of the most powerful theories are the simplest. Thus, a model for the banking   
data that includes only age, education, and wealth is simpler than one with four variables;   
because of the multicollinearity issue, there would be little to gain by including income   
in the model. Whether the model explains 93% or 94% of the variation in bank deposits   
would probably make little difference. Therefore, building good regression models relies   
as much on experience and judgment as it does on technical analysis.

An issue that one often faces in using trendlines and regression is

**overfitting**

the

model. It is important to realize that sample data may have unusual variability that is dif-  
ferent from the population; if we fit a model too closely to the sample data, we risk not   
fitting it well to the population in which we are interested. For instance, in fitting the crude   
[oil prices in Example 8.2, we noted that the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#316)

*R*

2

value will increase if we fit higher-order

polynomial functions to the data. While this might provide a better mathematical fit to the   
sample data, doing so can make it difficult to explain the phenomena rationally. The same   
thing can happen with multiple regression. If we add too many terms to the model, then   
the model may not adequately predict other values from the population. Overfitting can be   
mitigated by using good logic, intuition, physical or behavioral theory, and parsimony, as   
we have discussed.

Some data of interest in a regression study may be ordinal or nominal. This is common   
when including demographic data in marketing studies, for example. Because regression   
analysis requires numerical data, we could include categorical variables by

the vari-

not, we might code no as 0 and yes as 1. Such variables are often called

provides salary and age data for 35 employees, along with   
an indicator of whether or not the employees have an MBA   
(yes or no). The MBA indicator variable is categorical; thus,   
we code it by replacing no with 0 and yes with 1.

If we are interested in predicting salary as a function of

the other variables, we would propose the model

This model suggests that having an MBA increases the salary   
of this group of employees by almost $15,000. Note that by   
substituting either 0 or 1 for MBA, we obtain two models:

The only difference between them is the intercept. The   
models suggest that the rate of salary increase for age is   
the same for both groups. Of course, this may not be true.   
Individuals with MBAs might earn relatively higher salaries   
as they get older. In other words, the slope of age may

depend

on the value of MBA.

Linear regression models are not appropriate for every situation. A scatter chart of the   
data might show a nonlinear relationship, or the residuals for a linear fit might result in   
a nonlinear pattern. In such cases, we might propose a nonlinear model to explain the   
relationship. For instance, a second-order polynomial model would be

*Y*

=

b

0

+

b

1

*X*

+

b

2

*X*

2

+

e

Sometimes, this is called a

**curvilinear regression model**

. In this model,

b

1

represents

the linear effect of

*X*

on

*Y*

, and

b

2

represents the curvilinear effect. However, although this

model appears to be quite different from ordinary linear regression models, it is still

*linear*

*in the parameters*

(the betas, which are the unknowns that we are trying to estimate). In

other words, all terms are a product of a beta coefficient and some function of the data,   
which are simply numerical values. In such cases, we can still apply least squares to esti-  
mate the regression coefficients.

Curvilinear regression models are also often used in forecasting when the independent

variable is time. This and other applications of regression in forecasting are discussed in   
the next chapter.

Modeling Beverage Sales Using Curvilinear Regression

The Excel file

Beverage Sales

provides data on the sales of

cold beverages at a small restaurant with a large outdoor   
patio during the summer months (see [Figure 8.34](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#345)). The owner   
has observed that sales tend to increase on hotter days.   
[Figure 8.35](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#345)shows linear regression results for these data.   
The U-shape of the residual plot (a second-order polynomial   
trendline was fit to the residual data) suggests that a linear   
relationship is not appropriate. To apply a curvilinear regres-  
sion model, add a column to the data matrix by squaring

the temperatures. Now, both temperature and temperature   
squared are the independent variables. [Figure 8.36](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#346) shows   
the results for the curvilinear regression model. The model is

Note that the adjusted

In reviewing the data in the

*Performance Lawn Equipment*

*Database*

, Elizabeth Burke noticed that defects received

from suppliers have decreased (worksheet

*Defects After*

*Delivery*

). Upon investigation, she learned that in 2014,

PLE experienced some quality problems due to an increas-  
ing number of defects in materials received from suppli-  
ers. The company instituted an initiative in August 2015   
to work with suppliers to reduce these defects, to more   
closely coordinate deliveries, and to improve materials   
quality through reengineering supplier production policies.   
Ms. Burke noted that the program appeared to reverse an

increasing trend in defects; she would like to predict what   
might have happened had the supplier initiative not been   
implemented and how the number of defects might further   
be reduced in the near future.

In meeting with PLE's human resources director, Ms.

Burke also discovered a concern about the high rate of turn-  
over in its field service staff. Senior managers have suggested   
that the department look closer at its recruiting policies, par-  
ticularly to try to identify the characteristics of individuals   
that lead to greater retention. However, in a recent staff meet-  
ing, HR managers could not agree on these characteristics.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive352.png)

Some argued that years of education and grade point aver-  
ages were good predictors. Others argued that hiring more   
mature applicants would lead to greater retention. To study   
these factors, the staff agreed to conduct a statistical study   
to determine the effect that years of education, college   
grade point average, and age when hired have on retention.   
A sample of 40 field service engineers hired ten years ago   
was selected to determine the influence of these variables on   
how long each individual stayed with the company. Data are   
compiled in the

*Employee Retention*

worksheet.

Finally, as part of its efforts to remain competitive,

PLE tries to keep up with the latest in production technol-  
ogy. This is especially important in the highly competi-  
tive lawn mower line, where competitors can gain a real   
advantage if they develop more cost-effective means of   
production. The lawn mower division therefore spends a   
great deal of effort in testing new technology. When new

production technology is introduced, firms often experi-  
ence learning, resulting in a gradual decrease in the time   
required to produce successive units. Generally, the rate   
of improvement declines until the production time lev-  
els off. One example is the production of a new design   
for lawn mower engines. To determine the time required   
to produce these engines, PLE produced 50 units on its   
production line; test results are given on the worksheet

*Engines*

in the database. Because PLE is continually

developing new technology, understanding the rate of   
learning can be useful in estimating future production   
costs without having to run extensive prototype trials, and   
Ms. Burke would like a better handle on this.

Use trendlines and regression analysis to assist her in

evaluating the data in these three worksheets and reach-  
ing useful conclusions. Summarize your work in a formal   
report with all appropriate results and analyses.

Forecasting Techniques

Many of you are familiar with L.L.Bean, a retailer of high-  
quality outdoor gear. A large percentage of the compa-  
ny's sales are generated through orders to its call center   
(the call center can account for over 70% of the total   
sales volume). Calls to the L.L.Bean call center are clas-  
sified into two types: telemarketing (TM) and telephone   
inquiry (TI). TM calls are those made for placing an order,   
whereas TI calls involve customer inquiries, such as   
order status or order problems. TM calls and TI calls dif-  
fer in duration and volume. The annual call volume for TM   
calls is much higher than that for TI calls, but the duration   
of a TI call is generally much longer than the duration of   
a TM call.

[ANALYTICS IN PRACTICE:](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

Accurately forecasting the demand of TM and TI calls is

very important to L.L.Bean to reduce costs. Accurate fore-  
casts allow for properly planning the number of agents to   
have on hand at any point in time. Too few agents result in   
lost sales, loss of customer loyalty, excessive queue times,   
and increased phone charges. Too many agents obviously   
result in unnecessary labor costs.

L.L.Bean developed analytical forecasting models for

both TM and TI calls. These models took into account histori-  
cal trends, seasonal factors, and external explanatory vari-  
ables such as holidays and catalog mailings. The estimated   
benefit from better precision from the two forecasting models   
was approximately $300,000 per year.

Managers require good forecasts of future events to make good decisions. For

example, forecasts of interest rates, energy prices, and other economic indicators

are needed for financial planning; sales forecasts are needed to plan produc-

tion and workforce capacity; and forecasts of trends in demographics, consumer

behavior, and technological innovation are needed for long-term strategic plan-

ning. The government also invests significant resources on predicting short-run

U.S. business performance using the index of leading economic indicators (LEI).

This index focuses on the performance of individual businesses, which often is

highly correlated with the performance of the overall economy and is used to

forecast economic trends for the nation as a whole. In this chapter, we introduce

some common methods and approaches to forecasting, including both qualita-

tive and quantitative techniques.

Business analysts may choose from a wide range of forecasting techniques

to support decision making. Selecting the appropriate method depends on the

characteristics of the forecasting problem, such as the time horizon of the vari-

able being forecast, as well as available information on which the forecast will

be based. Three major categories of forecasting approaches are

qualitative and

judgmental techniques

,

statistical time-series models

, and

explanatory/causal

methods

. In this chapter, we introduce a variety of forecasting techniques and

use basic Excel tools and linear regression to implement them on spreadsheets.

Analogies often provide good forecasts, but you need to be careful to recognize new

or different circumstances. Another analogy is international conflict relative to the price   
of oil. Should war break out, the price would be expected to rise, analogous to what it has   
done in the past.

[The Delphi Method](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

A popular judgmental forecasting approach, called the

**Delphi method**

, uses a panel of

experts, whose identities are typically kept confidential from one another, to respond to a   
sequence of questionnaires. After each round of responses, individual opinions, edited to   
ensure anonymity, are shared, allowing each to see what the other experts think. Seeing   
other experts' opinions helps to reinforce those in agreement and to influence those who   
did not agree to possibly consider other factors. In the next round, the experts revise their   
estimates, and the process is repeated, usually for no more than two or three rounds. The   
Delphi method promotes unbiased exchanges of ideas and discussion and usually results in

[Qualitative and Judgmental Forecasting](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

Qualitative and judgmental techniques rely on experience and intuition; they are necessary   
when historical data are not available or when the decision maker needs to forecast far   
into the future. For example, a forecast of when the next generation of a microprocessor   
will be available and what capabilities it might have will depend greatly on the opinions   
and expertise of individuals who understand the technology. Another use of judgmental   
methods is to incorporate nonquantitative information, such as the impact of government   
regulations or competitor behavior, in a quantitative forecast. Judgmental techniques range   
from such simple methods as a manager's opinion or a group-based jury of executive opin-  
ion to more structured approaches such as historical analogy and the Delphi method.

[Historical Analogy](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

One judgmental approach is

**historical analogy**

, in which a forecast is obtained through

a comparative analysis with a previous situation. For example, if a new product is being   
introduced, the response of consumers to marketing campaigns to similar, previous products   
can be used as a basis to predict how the new marketing campaign might fare. Of course,   
temporal changes or other unique factors might not be fully considered in such an approach.   
However, a great deal of insight can often be gained through an analysis of past experiences.

EXAMPLE 9.1

Predicting the Price of Oil

In early 1998, the price of oil was about $22 a barrel.   
However, in mid-1998, the price of a barrel of oil dropped   
to around $11. The reasons for this price drop included an   
oversupply of oil from new production in the Caspian Sea   
region, high production in non-OPEC regions, and lower-  
than-normal demand. In similar circumstances in the past,   
OPEC would meet and take action to raise the price of

oil. Thus, from historical analogy, we might forecast a rise   
in the price of oil. OPEC members did, in fact, meet in   
mid-1998 and agreed to cut their production, but nobody   
believed that they would actually cooperate effectively,   
and the price continued to drop for a time. Subsequently,   
in 2000, the price of oil rose dramatically, falling again in   
late 2001.

some convergence of opinion. It is one of the better approaches to forecasting long-range   
trends and impacts.

[Indicators and Indexes](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

Indicators and indexes generally play an important role in developing judgmental fore-  
casts.

**Indicators**

are measures that are believed to influence the behavior of a variable we

wish to forecast. By monitoring changes in indicators, we expect to gain insight about the   
future behavior of the variable to help forecast the future.

EXAMPLE 9.2

Economic Indicators

One variable that is important to the nation's economy is   
the gross domestic product (GDP), which is a measure of   
the value of all goods and services produced in the United   
States. Despite its shortcomings (for instance, unpaid work   
such as housekeeping and child care is not measured;   
production of poor-quality output inflates the measure, as   
does work expended on corrective action), it is a practical   
and useful measure of economic performance. Like most   
time series, the GDP rises and falls in a cyclical fashion. Pre-  
dicting future trends in the GDP is often done by analyzing

leading indicators

---series that tend to rise and fall for some

predictable length of time prior to the peaks and valleys of   
the GDP. One example of a leading indicator is the formation   
of business enterprises; if the rate of new businesses grows,   
we would expect the GDP to increase in the near future.   
Additional examples of leading indicators are the percent   
change in the money supply (M1) and net change in business   
loans. Other indicators, called

lagging indicators

, tend to have

peaks and valleys that follow those of the GDP. Some lagging   
indicators are the Consumer Price Index, prime rate, business   
investment expenditures, and inventories on hand. The GDP   
can be used to predict future trends in these indicators.

EXAMPLE 9.3

Leading Economic Indicators

The Department of Commerce initiated an index of leading   
indicators to help predict future economic performance.   
Components of the index include the following:

■

average weekly hours, manufacturing

■

average weekly initial claims, unemployment   
insurance

■

new orders, consumer goods, materials

■

vendor performance---slower deliveries

■

new orders, nondefense capital goods

■

building permits, private housing

■

stock prices, 500 common stocks (Standard \& Poor)

■

money supply

■

interest rate spread

■

index of consumer expectations (University of Michigan)

Business Conditions Digest

included more than

100 time series in seven economic areas. This publication   
was discontinued in March 1990, but information related   
to the index of leading indicators was continued in

Survey

of Current Business

. In December 1995, the U.S. Depart-

ment of Commerce sold this data source to the Conference   
Board, which now markets the information under the title

Business Cycle Indicators

; information can be obtained at

[its Web site (www.conference-board.org). The site includes](http://www.conferenceboard.org/)excellent current information about the calculation of the   
index as well as its current components.

Indicators are often combined quantitatively into an

**index**

, a single measure that

weights multiple indicators, thus providing a measure of overall expectation. For example,   
financial analysts use the Dow Jones Industrial Average as an index of general stock mar-  
ket performance. Indexes do not provide a complete forecast but rather a better picture of   
direction of change and thus play an important role in judgmental forecasting.

Statistical time-series models find greater applicability for short-range forecasting prob-  
lems. A

**time series**

is a stream of historical data, such as weekly sales. We characterize the

values of a time series over

*T*

periods as

*A*

*t*

,

*t*

=

1, 2,

c

,

*T*

. Time-series models assume

that whatever forces have influenced sales in the recent past will continue into the near   
future; thus, forecasts are developed by extrapolating these data into the future. Time series   
generally have one or more of the following components: random behavior, trends, sea-  
sonal effects, and cyclical effects. Time series that do not have trend, seasonal, or cyclical   
effects but are relatively constant and exhibit only random behavior are called

**stationary**

**time series**

.

Many forecasts are based on analysis of historical time-series data and are predicated

on the assumption that the future is an extrapolation of the past. A

**trend**

is a gradual

upward or downward movement of a time series over time.

from the data in the Excel file

Energy Production \&

Consumption

. This time series shows an upward trend.

However, we see that energy consumption was rising   
quite rapidly in a linear fashion during the 1960s, then

leveled off for a while and began increasing at a slower   
rate through the 1980s and 1990s. At the end of the time   
series, we actually see a slight downward trend. This   
time series, then, is composed of several different short   
trends.

Time series may also exhibit short-term

, or nonlinear trends. A

**seasonal effect**

is one that repeats at fixed intervals of time,

typically a year, month, week, or day. At a neighborhood grocery store, for instance, short-  
term seasonal patterns may occur over a week, with the heaviest volume of customers on   
weekends; seasonal patterns may also be evident during the course of a day, with higher   
volumes in the mornings and l[ate afternoons. Figure 9.2 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#359)ws seasonal changes in natural

*moving average methods*

, and

*regression analysis*

. These can be implemented very easily on a spread-

sheet using basic functions and

*Data Analysis*

tools available in Microsoft Excel, as well as

with more powerful software such as

(see the online supplement described

in the Technology Help section). Moving average and exponential smoothing models   
work best for time series that do not exhibit trends or seasonal factors. For time series   
that involve trends and/or seasonal factors, other techniques have been developed. These   
include double moving average and exponential smoothing models, seasonal additive and   
multiplicative models, and Holt-Winters additive and multiplicative models.

Two simple approaches that are useful over short time periods when trend, seasonal, or   
cyclical effects are not significant are moving average and exponential smoothing models.

[Moving Average Models](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

The

**simple moving average**

method is a smoothing method based on the idea of averag-

ing random fluctuations in the time series to identify the underlying direction in which the   
time series is changing. Because the moving average method assumes that future obser-  
vations will be similar to the recent past, it is most useful as a short-range forecasting   
method. Although this method is very simple, it has proven to be quite useful in stable   
environments, such as inventory management, in which it is necessary to develop forecasts   
for a large number of items.

Specifically, the simple moving average forecast for the next period is computed as the

average of the most recent

*k*

observations. Specifically, let

*A*

*t*

represent the observed value in

period

*t*

, and

*F*

*t*

the forecast for period

*t*

. Then the forecast for the period

*t*

**(9.1)**

The value of

*k*

is somewhat arbitrary, although its choice affects the accuracy of the

forecast. The larger the value of

*k*

, the more the current forecast is dependent on older data,

and the forecast will not react as quickly to fluctuations in the time series. The smaller the   
value of

*k*

, the quicker the forecast responds to changes in the time series. Also, when

*k*

is larger, extreme values have less effect on the forecasts. (In the next section, we discuss   
how to select

*k*

by examining errors associated with different values.)

with the forecasted values. Although the forecast tracks the   
actual data fairly well, notice that the forecast overestimates   
the actual value when the trend is down, while it underesti-  
mates the actual value when the trend is up. This is because   
it uses past data, and thus lags the changes in the data.

[Error Metrics and Forecast Accuracy](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

The quality of a forecast depends on how accurate it is in predicting future values of a   
time series. In the simple moving average model, different values for

*k*

will produce differ-

ent forecasts. How do we know which is the best value for

*k*

? The error, or residual, in a

forecast is the difference between the forecast and the actual value of the time series (once   
it is known). In[Figure 9.6,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#361) the forecast error is simply the vertical distance between the   
forecast and the data for the same time period.

To analyze the effectiveness of different forecasting models, we can define

*error met-*

*rics*

, which compare quantitatively the forecast with the actual observations. Three metrics

that are commonly used are the

*mean absolute deviation*

,

*mean square error*

, and

*mean*

*absolute percentage error*

. The

**mean absolute deviation (MAD)**

is the absolute differ-

ence between the actual value and the forecast, averaged over a range of forecasted values:

To align the actual data with the forecasted values in the

to

be one row below the first row of the time series. (See   
[Figure 9.8.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#363) The first value of the time series starts in cell   
B4, so the output range is chosen to start in cell C5.). You   
may also obtain a chart of the data and the moving aver-  
ages, as well as a column of standard errors, by checking

the appropriate boxes. However, we

do not recommend

using the chart or error options because the forecasts   
generated by this tool are not properly aligned with the   
data (the forecast value aligned with a particular data point   
represents the forecast for the

be misleading. Rather, we recommend that you generate   
your own chart, as we did in[Figure 9.6.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#361) [Figure 9.8](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#363)shows

a forecast value associated with the first

data points). MAD provides a robust measure of

error and is less affected by extreme observations.

**Mean square error (MSE)**

is probably the most commonly used error metric. It

penalizes larger errors because squaring larger numbers has a greater impact than squaring   
smaller numbers. The formula for MSE is

represents the number of forecast values used in computing the average. Some-

times the square root of MSE, called the

**root mean square error (RMSE)**

, is used:

Note that unlike MSE, RMSE is expressed in the same units as the data (similar to the   
difference between a standard deviation and a variance), allowing for more practical   
comparisons.

A fourth commonly used metric is

**mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)**

. MAPE

is the average of absolute errors divided by actual observation values.

**(9.5)**

The values of MAD and MSE depend on the measurement scale of the time-series

data. For example, forecasting profit in the range of millions of dollars would result in very   
large MAD and MSE values, even for very accurate forecasting models. On the other hand,   
market share is measured in proportions; therefore, even bad forecasting models will have   
small values of MAD and MSE. Thus, these measures have no meaning except in compari-  
son with other models used to forecast the same data. Generally, MAD is less affected by

extreme observations and is preferable to MSE if such extreme observations are considered   
rare events with no special meaning. MAPE is different in that the measurement scale is   
eliminated by dividing the absolute error by the time-series data value. This allows a better   
relative comparison. Although these comments provide some guidelines, there is no uni-  
versal agreement on which measure is best.

EXAMPLE 9.7

Using Error Metrics to Compare Moving Average Forecasts

The metrics we have described can be used to compare   
different moving average forecasts for the

Tablet Com-

puter Sales

data. A spreadsheet that shows the forecasts

as well as the calculations of the error metrics for two-,   
three-, and four-period moving average models is given in   
[Figure 9.9.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#364) The error is the difference between the actual   
value of the units sold and the forecast. To compute MAD,   
we first compute the absolute values of the errors and

then average them. For MSE, we compute the squared   
errors and then find the average (we may easily compute   
RMSE if desired). For MAPE, we find the absolute values   
of the errors divided by the actual observation multiplied   
by 100 and then average them. The results suggest that a   
two-period moving average model provides the best fore-  
cast among these alternatives because the error metrics   
are all smaller than for the other models.

A versatile, yet highly effective, approach for short-range forecasting is

**simple exponen-**

**tial smoothing**

. The basic simple exponential smoothing model is

is the forecast for time period

*t*

*F*

*t*

**smoothing**

**constant**

. To begin, set

*F*

and

*F*

equal to the actual observation in period 1,

*A*

.

Using the two forms of the forecast equation just given, we can interpret the simple

exponential smoothing model in two ways. In the first model, the forecast for the next   
period,

*F*

, is a weighted average of the forecast made for period

*t*

,

*F*

Forecasting Techniques

observation in period

*t*

,

*A*

*t*

. The second form of the model, obtained by simply rearrang-

ing terms, states that the forecast for the next period,

*F*

*t*

, equals the forecast for the last

period,

*F*

*t*

, plus a fraction

a

of the forecast error made in period

*t*

,

*A*

-

*F*

*t*

. Thus, to make a

forecast once we have selected the smoothing constant, we need to know only the previous   
forecast and the actual value. By repeated substitution for

*F*

*t*

in the equation, it is easy to

demonstrate that

*F*

*t*

+

1

is a decreasingly weighted average of all past time-series data. Thus,

the forecast actually reflects

*all*

the data, provided that

a

is strictly between 0 and 1.

EXAMPLE 9.8

Using Exponential Smoothing to Forecast

Tablet Computer Sales

For the

Tablet Computer Sales

data, the forecast for week

2 is 88, the actual observation for week 1. Suppose we   
choose

a

=

0.7; then the forecast for week 3 would be

Week 3 Forecast

=

(1

-

0.7)(88)

+

(0.7)(44)

=

57.2

The actual observation for week 3 is 60; thus, the forecast   
for week 4 would be

Week 4 Forecast

=

(1

-

0.7)(57.2)

+

(0.7)(60)

=

59.16

Because the simple exponential smoothing model requires only the previous forecast

and the current time-series value, it is very easy to calculate; thus, it is highly suitable   
for environments such as inventory systems, where many forecasts must be made. The   
smoothing constant

a

is usually chosen by experimentation in the same manner as choos-

ing the number of periods to use in the moving average model. Different values of

a

affect

how quickly the model responds to changes in the time series. For instance, a value of

a

=

0 would simply repeat last period's forecast, whereas

a

=

1 would forecast the last

period's actual demand. The closer

a

is to 1, the quicker the model responds to changes in

the time series, because it puts more weight on the actual current observation than on the   
forecast. Likewise, the closer

a

is to 0, the more weight is put on the prior forecast, so the

model would respond to changes more slowly.

[Equation 9.7](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#367)looks similar to the equation for simple linear regression. We introduced   
regression in the previous chapter as a means of developing relationships between a depen-  
dent and independent variables. Simple linear regression can be applied to forecasting   
using time as the independent variable.

In [Chapter 8](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#312), we noted that an important assumption for using regression analysis

is the lack of autocorrelation among the data. When autocorrelation is present, succes-  
sive observations are correlated with one another; for example, large observations tend to   
follow other large observations, and small observations also tend to follow one another.   
This can often be seen by examining the residual plot when the data are ordered by time.   
[Figure 9.16](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#370)shows the time-ordered residual plot from the Excel

*Regression*

tool for the

coal production example. The residuals do not appear to be random; rather, successive   
observations seem to be related to one another. This suggests autocorrelation, indicating   
that other approaches, called

*autoregressive models*

, are more appropriate. However, these

are more advanced than the level of this book and are not discussed here.

Quite often, time-series data exhibit seasonality. A "season" can be a year, a quarter, a   
month, or even a week, depending on the application. Most often, it is a year. We saw an   
example of this in [Figure 9.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#359). When time series exhibit seasonality, different techniques   
provide better forecasts than the ones we have described.

One approach is to use linear regression. Multiple linear regression models with categori-  
cal variables can be used for time series with seasonality. To do this, we use dummy cat-  
egorical variables for the seasonal components.

[Holt-Winters Models for Forecasting Time Series with
Seasonality and No Trend](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#12)

The methods we describe here and in the next section are based on the work of two   
researchers, C.C. Holt, who developed the basic approach, and P.R. Winters, who   
extended Holt's work. Hence, these approaches are commonly referred to as

**Holt-**

**Winters models**

. Holt-Winters models are similar to exponential smoothing models in

that smoothing constants are used to smooth out variations in the level and seasonal   
patterns over time.

For time series with seasonality but no trend, we can use one of two models, the

**Holt-Winters additive seasonality model with no trend**

,

*F*

*t*

+

*k*

=

*a*

*t*

+

*S*

*t*

-

*s*

+

*k*

**(9.10)**

or the

**Holt-Winters multiplicative seasonality model with no trend**

:

*F*

*t*

+

*k*

=

*a*

*t*

*S*

*t*

-

*s*

+

*k*

**(9.11)**

The additive model applies to time series with relatively stable seasonality, whereas the   
multiplicative model apples to time series whose amplitude increases or decreases over   
time. Therefore, a chart of the time series should be viewed first to identify the type of   
model to use.

In both models,

*S*

*j*

is the seasonal factor for period

*j*

and

*s*

is the number of periods

in a season. The forecast for period

*t*

+

*k*

is adjusted up or down from a level (

*a*

*t*

) by the

seasonal factor. The multiplicative model is more appropriate when the seasonal factors are   
increasing or decreasing over time.

Holt-Winters Additive Seasonality Model with No Trend

The level and seasonal factors are estimated in the additive model using the following   
equations:

Level component:

*a*

*t*

=

a

(

*A*

*t*

-

*S*

*t*

-

*s*

)

+

(1

-

a

)

*a*

*t*

-

1

Seasonal component:

*S*

*t*

=

g

(

*A*

*t*

-

*a*

*t*

)

+

(1

-

g

)

*S*

*t*

-

*s*

**(9.12)**

where

a

and

g

are smoothing constants. The first equation estimates the level for period

*t*

as a weighted average of the deseasonalized data for period

*t*

, (

*A*

*t*

-

*S*

*t*

-

*s*

), and the previ-

ous period's level. The seasonal factors are updated as well using the second equation.   
The seasonal factor is a weighted average of the estimated seasonal component for period

*t*

, (

*A*

*t*

-

*a*

*t*

), and the seasonal factor for the last period of that season type. Then the forecast

for the next period is

*F*

*t*

+

1

=

*a*

*t*

+

*S*

*t*

-

*s*

+

1

.

To begin, we need to estimate the level and seasonal factors for the first

*s*

periods (that

is, the length of a season; for an annual season with quarterly data, this would be the first   
4 periods; for monthly data, it would be the first 12 periods, and so on) before we can use   
the smoothing equations. We do this as follows:

*a*

*t*

=

1

*s*

a

*s*

*i*

=

1

*A*

*i*

, for

*t*

=

1, 2,

c

,

*s*

**(9.13)**

and

*S*

*t*

=

*A*

*t*

-

*a*

*t*

, for

*t*

=

1, 2,

c

,

*s*

**(9.14)**

Then we can use the smoothing equations to update

*a*

*t*

and

*S*

*t*

and calculate forecasts.

seasonal model with some key differences:

+

*S*

*t*

-

**(9.15)**

where

a

and

g

are again the smoothing constants. Here,

*A*

*t*

/

*S*

*t*

-

*s*

is the deseasonalized esti-

mate for period

*t*

. Large values of

a

put more emphasis on this term in estimating the level

for period

*t*

. The term

*A*

*t*

/

*a*

*t*

is an estimate of the seasonal factor for period

*t*

. Large values

of

g

put more emphasis on this in the estimate of the seasonal factor. The forecast for the

next period is

*F*

*t*

+

1

=

*a*

*t*

*S*

*t*

-

*s*

+

1

.

As with the additive model, first initialize the values for the level and seasonal factors.

In this case, the formulas are

*a*

*t*

=

*s*

*s*

*i*

This model can be implemented on a spreadsheet in a similar fashion as the additive   
model.

Many time series exhibit both trend and seasonality. Such might be the case for growing   
sales of a seasonal product. These models combine elements of both the trend and seasonal   
models. Two types of Holt-Winters smoothing models are often used.

The

**Holt-Winters additive seasonality model**

with trend is based on the equation

*a*

*t*

*b*

*t*

*S*

and the

**(9.18)**

The additive model applies to time series with relatively stable seasonality and a trend,   
whereas the multiplicative model applies to time series whose amplitude increases or   
decreases over time along with a trend. As with the no trend case, a chart of the time series   
should be viewed first to identify the appropriate type of model to use. Three parameters,

a

,

b

, and

g

, are used to smooth the level, trend, and seasonal factors in the time series.

Holt-Winters Additive Seasonality Model with Trend

This model is similar to the additive model that incorporates only seasonality, but with the   
addition of a trend component:

Using the Holt-Winters Additive Model for Seasonality and Trend

We will use the data in the Excel file

which contains three years of monthly retail sales data.

in the time series and appears to be stable, and there   
is an increasing trend; therefore, the Holt-Winters addi-  
tive model with seasonality and trend would appear to   
be the most appropriate model. We arbitrarily select

a

find a best fit using an error measure such as MAD or MSE.

In many forecasting applications, other independent variables besides time, such as eco-  
nomic indexes or demographic factors, may influence the time series. For example, a man-  
ufacturer of hospital equipment might include such variables as hospital capital spending   
and changes in the proportion of people over the age of 65 in building models to forecast   
future sales. Explanatory/causal models, often called

**econometric models**

, seek to iden-

tify factors that explain statistically the patterns observed in the variable being forecast,   
usually with regression analysis. We will use a simple example of forecasting gasoline   
sales to illustrate econometric modeling.

In the

*Gasoline Sales*

data, we also see that the average price per gallon changes each

week, and this may influence consumer sales. Therefore, the sales trend might not simply   
be a factor of steadily increasing demand, but it might also be influenced by the average   
price per gallon. The average price per gallon can be considered as a

*causal variable*

.

Multiple linear regression provides a technique for building forecasting models that incor-  
porate not only time, but also other potential causal variables.

Surveys of forecasting practices have shown that both judgmental and quantitative meth-  
ods are used for forecasting sales of product lines or product families as well as for   
broad company and industry forecasts. Simple time-series models are used for short- and   
medium-range forecasts, whereas regression analysis is the most popular method for long-  
range forecasting. However, many companies rely on judgmental methods far more than

Forecasting Techniques

quantitative methods, and almost half judgmentally adjust quantitative forecasts. In this   
chapter, we focus on these three approaches to forecasting.

In practice, managers use a variety of judgmental and quantitative forecasting tech-

niques. Statistical methods alone cannot account for such factors as sales promotions,   
unusual environmental disturbances, new product introductions, large one-time orders, and   
so on. Many managers begin with a statistical forecast and adjust it to account for intangi-  
ble factors. Others may develop independent judgmental and statistical forecasts and then   
combine them, either objectively by averaging or in a subjective manner. It is important to   
compare quantitatively generated forecasts to judgmental forecasts to see if the forecast-  
ing method is adding value in terms of an improved forecast. It is impossible to provide   
universal guidance as to which approaches are best, because they depend on a variety of   
factors, including the presence or absence of trends and seasonality, the number of data   
points available, the length of the forecast time horizon, and the experience and knowledge   
of the forecaster. Often, quantitative approaches will miss significant changes in the data,   
such as reversal of trends, whereas qualitative forecasts may catch them, particularly when   
using indicators as discussed earlier in this chapter.

NBCUniversal (NBCU), a subsidiary of Comcast, is one of   
the world's leading media and entertainment companies   
in the distribution, production, and marketing of entertain-  
ment, news, and information. The television broadcast   
year in the United States starts in the third week of   
September. The major broadcast networks announce   
their programming schedules for the new broadcast year   
in the middle of May. Shortly thereafter, the sale of

advertising time, which generates the majority of revenues,   
begins. The broadcast networks sell 60% to 80% of their air-  
time inventory during a brief period starting in late May and   
lasting two to three weeks. This sales period is known as

the

. Immediately after announcing their program

estimate the market demand. The ratings forecasts are pro-

demographic groups who are expected to watch each air-  
ing of the shows in the program schedule for the entire   
broadcast year. After they finalize their ratings projections   
and market-demand estimates, the networks set the rate   
cards that contain the prices for commercials on all their   
shows and develop pricing strategies.

Forecasting upfront market demand has always been

a challenge. NBCU initially relied on historical patterns,   
expert knowledge, and intuition for estimating demand.   
Later, it tried time-series forecasting models based on his-  
torical demand and leading economic indicator data and   
implemented the models in a Microsoft Excel--based sys-  
tem. However, these models proved to be unsatisfactory   
because of the unique nature of NBCU's demand popula-  
tion. The time-series models had fit and prediction errors   
in the range of 5% to 12% based on the historical data.   
These errors were considered reasonable, but the sales   
executives were reluctant to use the models because the   
models did not consider several qualitative factors that   
they believed influence the demand. As a result, they did   
not trust the forecasts that these models generated; there-  
fore, they never used them. Analytics staff at NBCU then   
decided to develop a qualitative demand forecasting model   
that captures the knowledge of the sales experts.

Their approach incorporates the Delphi method and

"grass-roots forecasting," which is based on the concept of

asking those who are close to the end consumer, such as   
salespeople, about the customers' purchasing plans, along   
with historical data to develop forecasts. Since 2004, more   
than 200 sales and finance personnel at NBCU have been   
using the system to support sales decisions during the   
upfront market when NBCU signs advertising deals worth   
more than $4.5 billion. The system enables NBCU to sell   
and analyze pricing scenarios across all NBCU's television   
properties with ease and sophistication while predicting   
demand with a high accuracy. NBCU's sales leaders credit   
the system with having given them a unique competitive   
advantage.

Chapter 10

Introduction to Data Mining

In an article in

Analytics

magazine, Talha Omer observed that using a cell phone to

make a voice call leaves behind a significant amount of data. "The cell phone pro-

vider knows every person you called, how long you talked, what time you called

and whether your call was successful or if was dropped. It also knows where you

are, where you make most of your calls from, which promotion you are responding

to, how many times you have bought before, and so on."

1

Considering the fact that

the vast majority of people today use cell phones, a huge amount of data about

consumer behavior is available. Similarly, many stores now use loyalty cards. At

supermarkets, drugstores, retail stores, and other outlets, loyalty cards enable con-

sumers to take advantage of sale prices available only to those who use the card.

However, when they do, the cards leave behind a digital trail of data about pur-

chasing patterns. How can a business exploit these data? If they can better under-

stand patterns and hidden relationships in the data, they can not only understand

buying habits but also customize advertisements, promotions, coupons, and so on

for each individual customer and send targeted text messages and e-mail offers

(we're not talking spam here, but registered users who opt into such messages).

Data mining

is a rapidly growing field of business analytics that is focused on

better understanding characteristics and patterns among variables in large data-

bases using a variety of statistical and analytical tools. Many of the tools that we

have studied in previous chapters, such as data visualization, data summarization,

PivotTables, and correlation and regression analysis, are used extensively in data

mining. However, as the amount of data has grown exponentially, many other sta-

tistical and analytical methods have been developed to identify relationships among

variables in large data sets and understand hidden patterns that they may contain.

Many data-mining procedures require advanced statistical knowledge

to understand the underlying theory and special software to implement them.

Therefore, our focus is on simple applications and understanding the purpose

and application of data-mining techniques rather than their theoretical underpin-

nings. In an optional online supplement, we describe the use of Analytic Solver

for implementing data-mining procedures.

[The Scope of Data Mining](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#13)

Data mining can be considered part descriptive and part prescriptive analytics. In descrip-  
tive analytics, data-mining tools help analysts to identify patterns in data. Excel charts and   
PivotTables, for example, are useful tools for describing patterns and analyzing data sets;

however, they require manual intervention. Regression analysis and forecasting models   
help us to predict relationships or future values of variables of interest. As some research-  
ers observe, "the boundaries between prediction and description are not sharp (some of the   
predictive models can be descriptive, to the degree that they are understandable, and vice   
versa)."

2

In most business applications, the purpose of descriptive analytics is to help man-

agers predict the future or make better decisions that will impact future performance, so we   
can generally state that data mining is primarily a predictive analytic approach.

Some common approaches in data mining include the following:

■

■

***Cluster analysis***

. Some basic techniques in data mining involve data exploration and

"data reduction"---that is, breaking down large sets of data into more-manageable   
groups or segments that provide better insight. We have seen numerous techniques   
earlier in this book for data exploration and data reduction. For example, charts,   
frequency distributions and histograms, and summary statistics provide basic   
information about the characteristics of data. PivotTables, in particular, are very   
useful in exploring data from different perspectives and for data reduction. Data   
mining software provide a variety of tools and techniques for data exploration that   
complement or extend the concepts and tools we have studied in previous   
chapters. This involves identifying groups in which the elements of the groups are   
in some way similar. This approach is often used to understand differences among   
customers and segment them into homogenous groups. For example, Macy's   
department stores identified four types of customers defined by their lifestyle:   
"Katherine," a traditional, classic dresser who doesn't take a lot of risks and likes   
quality; "Julie," neotraditional and slightly more edgy but still classic; "Erin," a   
contemporary customer who loves newness and shops by brand; and "Alex," the   
fashion customer who wants only the latest and greatest (they have male versions   
also).

3

Such segmentation is useful in design and marketing activities to better tar-

get product offerings. These techniques have also been used to identify character-  
istics of successful employees and improve recruiting and hiring practices.

■

■

***Classification***

. Classification is the process of analyzing data to predict how to

classify a new data element. An example of classification is spam filtering in an   
e-mail client. By examining textual characteristics of a message (subject header,   
key words, and so on), the message is classified as junk or not. Classification   
methods can help predict whether a credit card transaction may be fraudulent,   
whether a loan applicant is high risk, or whether a consumer will respond to an   
advertisement.

■

■

***Association***

. Association is the process of analyzing databases to identify natural

associations among variables and create rules for target marketing or buying rec-  
ommendations. For example, Netflix uses association to understand what types   
of movies a customer likes and provides recommendations based on the data.   
[Amazon.com also mak](http://amazon.com/)es recommendations based on past purchases. Supermar-  
ket loyalty cards collect data on customers' purchasing habits and print coupons   
at the point of purchase based on what was currently bought.

■

■

***Cause-and-effect modeling***

. Cause-and-effect modeling is the process of devel-

oping analytic models to describe the relationship between metrics that drive   
business performance---for instance, profitability, customer satisfaction, or

employee satisfaction. Understanding the drivers of performance can lead to bet-  
ter decisions to improve performance. For example, the controls group of Johnson   
Controls, Inc., examined the relationship between satisfaction and contract   
renewal rates. They found that 91% of contract renewals came from customers   
who were either satisfied or very satisfied, and customers who were not satisfied   
had a much higher defection rate. Their model predicted that a one-percentage-  
point increase in the overall satisfaction score was worth $13 million in service   
contract renewals annually. As a result, they identified decisions that would   
improve customer satisfaction.

[Cluster Analysis](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#13)

**Cluster analysis**

, also called

*data segmentation*

, is a set of techniques that seek to group

or segment a collection of objects (that is, observations or records) into subsets or clusters,   
such that those within each cluster are more closely related to one another than objects   
assigned to different clusters. The objects within clusters should exhibit a high amount of   
similarity, whereas those in different clusters will be dissimilar.

Cluster analysis is a data-reduction technique in the sense that it can take a large num-

ber of observations, such as customer surveys or questionnaires, and reduce the information   
into smaller, homogenous groups that can be interpreted more easily. The segmentation of   
customers into smaller groups, for example, can be used to customize advertising or pro-  
motions. As opposed to many other data-mining techniques, cluster analysis is primarily   
descriptive, and we cannot draw statistical inferences about a sample using it. In addition,   
the clusters identified are not unique and depend on the specific procedure used; therefore,   
it does not result in a definitive answer but only provides new ways of looking at data.   
Nevertheless, it is a widely used technique.

There are two major methods of clustering---hierarchical clustering and

*k*

-means clus-

tering. In

**hierarchical clustering**

, the data are not partitioned into a particular cluster in a

single step. Instead, a series of partitions takes place, which may run from a single cluster   
containing all objects to

*n*

clusters, each containing a single object. Hierarchical clustering

is subdivided into

**agglomerative clustering methods**

, which proceed by series of fusions

of the

*n*

objects into groups, and

**divisive clustering methods**

, which separate

*n*

objects

successively into f[iner groupings. Figure 10.1 illustrates the di](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#388)fferences between these two   
types of methods. Agglomerative techniques are more commonly used.

observations. At each particular stage, the method joins together

the two clusters that are closest together (most similar). At the first stage, this consists of   
simply joining together the two objects that are closest together. Different methods use dif-  
ferent ways of defining distance (or similarity) between clusters.

The most commonly used measure of distance between objects is

**Euclidean distance**

computed as the hypotenuse of a right tri[angle (see Figure 10.2).](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#388)The Euclidean distance

Some clustering methods use the squared Euclidean distance (that is, without the square

. The characteristics of these institutions differ

quite widely. Suppose that we wish to cluster them into

more homogeneous groups based on the median SAT,

acceptance rate, expenditures/student, percentage of

students in the top 10% of their high school, and gradu-

ation rate. We can use the Euclidean distance measure in

[formula (10.1)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#388) to measure the distance between them.

For example, the distance between Amherst and

Barnard is

We can implement this easily by using the Excel

function SUMXMY2(

,

array_y

), which sums the

squares of the differences in two corresponding ranges

or arrays. Therefore, the distance between Amherst and

Barnard would be computed by the Excel formula

=

SQRT(SUMXMY2(C4:G4, C5:G5)).  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive389.png)

When the data have different orders of magnitude, the distance measure can easily be   
dominated by the large values. Therefore, it is customary to standardize (or

**normalize**

)

the data by converting them into

*z*

One of the simplest agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods is

**single linkage clus-**

**tering**

, which is an agglomerative method that keeps forming clusters from the individual

objects until only one cluster is left. In the single linkage method, the distance between two   
clusters

*r*

and

*s, D(r, s),*

is defined as the minimum distance between any object in cluster

*r*

and any object in cluster

*s*

. In other words, the distance between two clusters is given by

the value of the shortest link between the clusters. Initially, each cluster simply consists of   
an individual object. At each stage of clustering, we find the two clusters with the mini-  
mum distance between them and merge them together.

Another method that is basically the opposite of single linkage clustering is called

**complete linkage clustering**

. In this method, the distance between clusters is defined as the

distance between the most distant pair of objects, one from each cluster. A third method is

**average linkage clustering**

. Here the distance between two clusters is defined as the average

of distances between all pairs of objects, where each pair is made up of one object from each   
group. Other methods are

**average group linkage clustering**

, which uses the mean values for

each variable to compute distances between clusters, and

**Ward's hierarchical clustering**

results, so it is best to experiment and compare the results. In the following example, we   
illustrate single linkage clustering.

. Looking at the distance matrix in[Table 10.1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#389), we

see that the smallest distance occurs between Amherst and

Bowdoin (0.7158). Thus, we join these two into a cluster.

Next, recalculate the distance between this cluster and the

remaining colleges by finding the minimum distance between

any college in the cluster and the others. This results in the

distance matrix shown in[Table 10.2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#390) Note that the smallest

distance between either Amherst or Bowdoin and Barnard,

for instance, is MIN(3.5284, 2.9744). This becomes the dis-

tance between the Amherst/Bowdoin cluster and Barnard.

[In Table 10.2, the smallest distance is between](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#390)

Barnard and Bates (1.879). Therefore, we join these two

colleges into a second cluster. This results in the distance

[matrix shown in Table 10.3.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#390)

Next, we join the Amherst/Bowdoin and Barnard/Bates

clusters together, as the smallest distance in [Table 10.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#390)

is 2.06125. This results in the distance matrix shown in

to the cluster of other colleges.

If we examine the original data, we can see that

Amherst and Bowdoin, and Barnard and Bates have similar

profiles, but that Berkeley is quite different:

Classification methods seek to classify a categorical outcome into one of two or more cat-  
egories based on various data attributes. For each record in a database, we have a categori-  
cal variable of interest (for example, purchase or not purchase, high risk or no risk), and a   
number of additional predictor variables (age, income, gender, education, assets, etc.). For   
a given set of predictor variables, we would like to assign the best value of the categorical   
variable. We will be illustrating various classification techniques using the Excel database

*Credit Approval Decisions*

.

A portion of this database is shown in [Figure 10.5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#392) In this database, the categorical

variable of interest is the decision to approve or reject a credit application. The remain-  
ing variables are the predictor variables. Because we are working with numerical data,   
however, we need to code the Homeowner and Decision fields numerically. We code the   
Homeowner attribute "Y" as 1 and "N" as 0; similarly, we code the Decision attribute   
"Approve" as 1 and "Reject" as 0. [Figure 10.6 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#392)ws a portion of the modified database   
(Excel file

*Credit Approval Decisions Coded*

).

At various stages of the clustering process, there are different numbers of clusters. We

can visualize this using a

**dendogram**

, which is sho[wn in Figure 10.4. The](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#391)

*y*

-axis measures

the intercluster distance. A dendogram shows the sequence in which clusters are formed   
as you move up the diagram. At the top, we see that all clusters are merged into a single   
cluster. If you draw a horizontal line through the dendogram at any value along the

*y*

-axis,

you can identify the number of clusters and the objects in each of them. For example, if   
you draw a line at the distance value of 2.0, you can see that we have the three clusters:   
{Amherst, Bowdoin}, {Barnard, Bates}, and {Berkeley}.

Classifying Credit-Approval Decisions Intuitively

years of credit history in the

Credit Approval Decisions

data. The chart plots the credit scores of loan applicants

on the

x

-axis and the years of credit history on the

y

-axis.

The large bubbles represent the applicants whose

credit applications were rejected; the small bubbles

represent those that were approved. With a few

exceptions (the points at the bottom right corresponding

to high credit scores with just a few years of credit

history that were rejected), there appears to be a clear

separation of the points. When the credit score is

greater than 640, the applications were approved, but

most applications with credit scores of 640 or less were

rejected. Thus, we might propose a simple classification

rule: approve an application with a credit score greater

than 640.

Another way of classifying the groups is to use both

the credit score and years of credit history by visually

drawing a straight line to separate the groups, as shown in

[Figure 10.8. This line passes through the points (763, 2) and](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#393)

tion of the line as

Therefore, we can propose a different classification rule:

whenever

again, however, we see some misclassification.

To develop an intuitive understanding of classification, we consider only the credit score   
and years of credit history as predictor variables.

Although this is easy to do intuitively for only two predictor variables, it is more

difficult to do when we have more predictor variables. Therefore, more-sophisticated   
procedures are needed, as we will discuss.

As we saw in the previous example, errors may occur with any classification rule, result-  
ing in misclassification. One way to judge the effectiveness of a classification rule is to   
find the probability of making a misclassification error and summarizing the results in a   

**classification matrix**

, which shows the number of cases that were classified either cor-

rectly or incorrectly.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive394.png)

The purpose of developing a classification model is to be able to classify new records.

After a classification scheme is chosen and the best model is developed based on existing   
data, we use the predictor variables as inputs to the model to predict the output.

EXAMPLE

10.4

Classification Matrix for Credit-Approval Classification Rules

In the credit-approval decision example, using just the credit

score to classify the applications, we see that in two cases,

applicants with credit scores exceeding 640 were rejected,

out of a total of 50 data points.[Table 10.5](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#394) shows a clas-

sification matrix for the credit score rule in[Figure 10.7.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#393) The

off-diagonal elements in the table are the frequencies of mis-

classification, whereas the diagonal elements are the numbers

that were correctly classified. Therefore, the probability of

misclassification was

2

50

, or 0.04. We leave it as an exercise for

you to develop a classification matrix for the second rule.

we would classify the decision for the first, third, and sixth

We will describe two different data-mining approaches used for classification:

*k*

-nearest

neighbors and discriminant analysis.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive395.png)

Chapter 10

Introduction to Data Mining

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

The

***k***

**-nearest neighbors (**

***k***

**-NN) algorithm**

is a classification scheme that attempts to

find records in a database that are similar to one we wish to classify. Similarity is based   
on the "closeness" of a record to numerical predictors in the other records. In the

*Credit*

*Approval Decisions*

database, we have the predictors Homeowner, Credit Score, Years of

Credit History, Revolving Balance, and Revolving Utilization. We seek to classify the deci-  
sion to approve or reject the credit application.

Suppose that the values of the predictors of two records

*X*

and

*Y*

are labeled

. We measure the distance between two records by the

Eucl[idean distance in formula (10.1). Because predictors often ha](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#388)ve different scales, they   
are often standardized before computing the distance.

Suppose we have a record

*X*

that we want to classify. The nearest neighbor to that

record is the one that has the smallest distance from it. The 1-NN rule then classifies record

*X*

in the same category as its nearest neighbor. We can extend this idea to a

*k*

-NN rule

by finding the

*k*

-nearest neighbors to each record we want to classify, and then assigning

the classification as the classification of a majority of the

*k*

-nearest neighbors. The

choice of

*k*

is somewhat arbitrary. If

*k*

is too small, the classification of a record is very

sensitive to the classification of the single record to which it is closest. A larger

*k*

reduces

this variability, but making

*k*

too large introduces bias into the classification decisions.

For example, if

*k*

is the count of the entire data set, all records will be classified the

same way. Like the smoothing constants for moving average or exponential smoothing   
forecasting, some experimentation is needed to find the best value of

*k*

to minimize

the misclassification rate. Data-mining software usually provides the ability to select   
a maximum value for

*k*

and evaluate the performance of the algorithm on all values of

*k*

up to the maximum specified value. Typically, values of

*k*

between 1 and 20 are used,

depending on the size of the data sets, and odd numbers are often used to avoid ties in   
computing the majority classification of the nearest neighbors.

EXAMPLE

Using

k

-NN for Classifying Credit-Approval Decisions

The Excel file

Credit Approval Decisions Classification Data

provides normalized data for the credit-approval decision

records (see [Figure 10.10)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#396). We would like to classify the new

records using the decisions that have already been made.

Consider the first new record, 51. Suppose we set

k

Classifying Credit Decisions Using Discriminant Analysis

For the credit-approval data, we want to model the deci-

we calculate the averages for each group of decisions.

(Note that the data have been sorted by decision to facili-

tate computing averages.)

Next, we need a rule for classifying observations

using the discriminant scores. This is done by computing

a

cut-off value

so that if a discriminant score is

less than or equal to it, the observation is assigned to

one group; otherwise, it is assigned to the other group.

While there are several ways of doing this, one simple

way is to use the midpoint of the average discriminant

scores:

Cut

(0.9083

=

0.4932

We see that all approval decisions have discriminant

scores above this cut-off value, while all rejection deci-

sions have scores below it. Data-mining software has

more sophisticated ways of performing the classifica-

tions. We may use this cut-off value to classify the new

[records. This is shown in Figure 10.13.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#398)

Discriminant Analysis

**Discriminant analysis**

is a technique for classifying a set of observations into predefined

classes. The purpose is to determine the class of an observation based on a set of predic-  
tor variables. We will illustrate discriminant analysis using the

*Credit Approval Decisions*

data. With only two classification groups, we can apply regression analysis. Unfortunately,   
when there are more than two, linear regression cannot be applied, and special software   
must be used.

Association rules identify attributes that frequently occur together in a given data set.

**Association rule mining**

, often called

*affinity analysis*

, seeks to uncover interesting asso-

ciations and/or correlation relationships among large sets of data. A typical and widely   
used example of association rule mining is

**market basket analysis**

. For example, super-

markets routinely collect data using barcode scanners. Each record lists all items bought   
by a customer for a single-purchase transaction. Such databases consist of a large number   
of transaction records. Managers would be interested to know if certain groups of items   
are consistently purchased together. They could use these data for adjusting store layouts   
(placing items optimally with respect to each other), for cross-selling, for promotions, for   
catalog design, and to identify customer segments based on buying patterns. Association   
rule mining is how companies such as Netfl[ix and Amazon.com mak](http://amazon.com/)e recommendations   
based on past movie rentals or item purchases, for example.

. The data represent the configurations for a small

number of orders of laptops placed over the Web. The

main options from which customers can choose are the

type of processor, screen size, memory, and hard drive.

A "1" signifies that a customer selected a particular option.

If the manufacturer can better understand what types of

components are often ordered together, it can speed up

final assembly by having partially completed laptops with

the most popular combinations of components configured

prior to order, thereby reducing delivery time and improving

customer satisfaction.

Association rules provide information in the form of if-then statements. These rules

are computed from the data but, unlike the if-then rules of logic, association rules are   
probabilistic in nature. In association analysis, the antecedent (the "if" part) and conse-  
quent (the "then" part) are sets of items (called

*item sets*

) that are disjoint (do not have any

items in common).

To measure the strength of association, an association rule has two numbers that

express the degree of uncertainty about the rule. The first number is called the

**support**

**for the (association) rule**

. The support is simply the number of transactions that include

all items in the antecedent and consequent parts of the rule. (The support is sometimes  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive400.png)

Chapter 10

expressed as a percentage of the total number of records in the database.) One way to think   
of support is that it is the probability that a randomly selected transaction from the data-  
base will contain all items in the antecedent and the consequent. The second number is the

**confidence of the (association) rule**

. Confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions

that include all items in the consequent as well as the antecedent (namely, the support) to   
the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent. The confidence is the   
conditional probability that a randomly selected transaction will include all the items in the   
consequent given that the transaction includes all the items in the antecedent:

<br />

Antecedent)

*P*

**(10.2)**

The higher the confidence, the more confident we are that the association rule provides   
useful information.

Another measure of the strength of an association rule is

**lift**

, which is defined as the

ratio of confidence to expected confidence. Expected confidence is the number of transac-  
tions that include the consequent divided by the total number of transactions. Expected   
confidence assumes independence between the consequent and the antecedent. Lift pro-  
vides information about the increase in probability of the "then" (consequent) given the   
"if" (antecedent) part. The higher the lift ratio, the stronger the association rule; a value   
greater than 1.0 is usually a good minimum.

EXAMPLE

10.9

Measuring Strength of Association

Suppose that a supermarket database has 100,000 point-

of-sale transactions, out of which 2,000 include both

items A and B and 800 of these include item C. The asso-

ciation rule "If A and B are purchased, then C is also pur-

chased" has a support of 800 transactions (alternatively,

Association rule mining requires special data-mining software to identify good rules.

However, we can obtain an intuitive understanding of this technique by examining correla-  
tions, as the next example illustrates.

file. Of course, this only shows the cor-

relation between pairs of variables; however, it can provide

some insight for understanding associations. Higher cor-

relations have been highlighted. For example, we see that

the highest correlation is between the Intel Core i7 and a

750-GB hard drive. Twelve records have the Core i7, and

17 records have a 750-GB hard drive. If we compute the

SUMPRODUCT of these two columns in the data, we find

that 8 of the 67 records have both of these components.

A simple association rule is

If an Intel Core i7 is chosen

(the

antecedent),

then a 750-GB hard drive is purchased

(the

consequent). The support for this rule is 8, and the con-

fidence is (8

We also see a moderate correlation between the

Core i7 and an 8-GB memory. Thus, we might propose

the rule

If an Intel Core i7 and 8-GB memory are purchased

(the antecedent),

then a 750-GB hard drive is purchased

(the consequent). In this case, only four records have all

three; hence the support is 4. Six records have both com-

ponents of the antecedent; therefore, the confidence would

Managers are always interested in results, such as profit, customer satisfaction and reten-  
tion, and production yield.

**Lagging measures**

, or outcomes, tell what has happened and

are often external business results, such as profit, market share, and customer satisfac-  
tion.

**Leading measures**

(performance drivers) predict what

*will*

happen and usually are

internal metrics, such as employee satisfaction, productivity, and turnover. For example,   
customer satisfaction results in regard to sales or service transactions are a lagging mea-  
sure; employee satisfaction, sales representative behavior, billing accuracy, and so on are   
examples of leading measures that might influence customer satisfaction. If employees are   
not satisfied, their behavior toward customers could be negatively affected, and customer   
satisfaction could be low. If this can be explained using business analytics, managers can   
take steps to improve employee satisfaction, leading to improved customer satisfaction.   
Therefore, it is important to understand what controllable factors significantly influence   
key business performance measures that managers cannot directly control. Correlation   
analysis can help to identify these influences and lead to the development of cause-and-  
effect models that can help managers make better decisions today that will influence   
results tomorrow.

Although correlation analysis does not prove any cause

and effect, we can logically infer that a cause-and-effect

relationship exists. The data indicate that customer satisfac-

tion, the key external business result, is strongly influenced

by internal factors that drive employee satisfaction. Logically,

we could propose the model shown in [Figure 10.18.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#403) This

suggests that if managers want to improve customer

satisfaction, they need to start by ensuring good relations

between supervisors and their employees and focus on

Many different companies use data mining to seg-

ment customers, identify the most profitable types of

customers, reduce costs, and enhance customer relation-

ships through improved marketing efforts. Some success-

ful application areas of data mining include the following:

■

■

A pharmaceutical company analyzed sales force activity

data to better target high-value physicians and deter-

mine which marketing activities will have the greatest

impact. Sales representatives can use the results and

plan their schedules and promotional activities.

■

■

A credit-card company used data mining to analyze cus-

tomer transaction data to identify customers most likely

to be interested in a new credit product. As a result, costs

for mail campaigns decreased by more than 20 times.

■

■

A large transportation company used data mining to seg-

ment its customer base and identify the best types of

customers for its services. By applying this segmentation

to a general business database such as those provided

by Dun \& Bradstreet, they can develop a prioritized list of

prospects for its regional sales force members.

Database provides data related to predicting

the level of business (Usage Level) obtained from a third-  
party survey of purchasing managers of firms that are cus-  
tomers of Performance Lawn Equipment.

The seven PLE

attributes rated by each respondent are the following:

*Delivery speed*

---the amount of time it takes to deliver

the product once an order is confirmed

*Price level*

---the perceived level of price charged by

PLE

*Price flexibility*

---the perceived willingness of PLE

representatives to negotiate price on all types of purchases

*Manufacturing image*

---the overall image of the

manufacturer

*Overall service*

---the overall level of service neces-

sary for maintaining a satisfactory relationship between   
PLE and the purchaser

*Sales force image*

---the overall image of PLE's sales

force

*Product quality*

---perceived level of quality

Responses to these seven variables were obtained

using a graphic rating scale, where a 10-centimeter line   
was drawn between endpoints labeled "poor" and "excel-  
lent." Respondents indicated their perceptions using a   
mark on the line, which was measured from the left end-  
point. The result was a scale from 0 to 10, rounded to one   
decimal place.

Two measures were obtained that reflected the out-

comes of the respondent's purchase relationships with PLE:

*Usage level*

---how much of the firm's total product

is purchased from PLE, measured on a 100-point scale,   
ranging from 0% to 100%

*Satisfaction level*

---how satisfied the purchaser is

with past purchases from PLE, measured on the same   
graphic rating scale as perceptions 1 through 7

The data also include four characteristics of the

responding firms:

*Size of firm*

---size relative to others in this market

(0

=

small; 1

=

large)

*Purchasing structure*

---the purchasing method used in

a particular company (1

=

centralized procurement, 0

=

decentralized procurement)

*Industry*

---the industry classification of the purchaser

\[1

=

retail (resale such as Home Depot), 0

Chapter 11

Spreadsheet Modeling and Analysis

Models are essential to understanding decision problems that managers face,

predicting the outcomes of decision alternatives, and finding the best decisions

to make; therefore, modeling is the heart and soul of business analytics.

We intr[oduced the concept of a decision model in Chapter 1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30)Decision mod-

els transform inputs---data, uncontrollable inputs, and decision options---into out-

puts, or measures of performance or behavior. When we build a decision model,

we are essentially predicting what outputs will occur based on the model inputs.

The model itself is simply a set of assumptions that characterize the relationships

between the inputs and the outputs. The quality of a model depends on the qual-

ity of the assumptions used to create it. This can only be assessed by compar-

ing model outputs to known results, either from the past or in the future. Thus,

model assumptions must be based either on sound logic and experience or on

the analysis of historical data that may be available.

In this chapter, we focus on building logical and useful decision models

using spreadsheets. We also describe approaches for analyzing models to evalu-

ate future scenarios and ask "what-if" questions to facilitate better business

decisions.

Being able to build spreadsheet models, understand their logic, and use them

to evaluate scenarios are important skills that professionals in all areas of busi-

ness can use in their daily work. For example, financial analysts use spreadsheet

models for predicting cash flow requirements in the future; marketing analysts

use them for evaluating the impact of advertising decisions and budget alloca-

tions; operations personnel use them for planning production and staffing require-

ments. Spreadsheet models are also used routinely in managerial accounting,

investment banking, consulting activities, and many other areas. We will begin

by considering some useful approaches to initiate the model-building process in

order to get a better understanding of the scenarios that we wish to model using

spreadsheets.

Building decision models is more of an art than a science. Creating good decision models   
requires a solid understanding of basic business principles in all functional areas, such   
as accounting, finance, marketing, and operations, knowledge of business practice and   
research, and logical skills. Models often evolve from simple to complex and from deter-  
ministic to stochastic (see the definitions in [Chapter 1)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30), so it is generally best to start   
simple and enrich models as necessary.

We introduced the concept of using logic and business principles to develop models in   
[Chapter 1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30) For instance, [Example 1.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#48) showed how to use the dimensions of terms to   
help develop logically consistent formulas. [Example 1.4](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#49) described a decision model for   
outsourcing. Let us look more closely at the logic of how that model was developed.

Nestlé is a large and well-known global food and bever-  
age company. Nestlé's executive information system (EIS)   
department gathers data from the firm's subsidiaries (report-  
ing units) to provide top management with operational, finan-  
cial, and strategic information. The EIS department decided   
to improve its service by using Excel-based business analyt-  
ics tools and encourage analysts and controllers to make   
better use of the information that these tools provide. They   
developed descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive spread-  
sheet models for evaluating the economic profitability of   
investment decisions, setting selling prices, managing cash   
flows, and evaluating business opportunities and risks.

Through this process, they discovered that spread-

sheets were extremely useful for developing small and   
simple (but not simplistic) quality models. As a result, they

made a concerted effort to increase the number of managers   
accustomed to using spreadsheet models and other analytic   
tools in their decision making. To do this, they developed and   
conducted seminars to train employees to use Excel to   
develop small spreadsheet models devoted to sensitivity   
analysis, forecasting, simulation, and optimization using   
mini-case studies. The teaching materials were adapted from   
real Nestlé data (for example, a forecast of the annual sales of   
ice cream in the U.S.). The goal was to encourage users to   
explore new problems by themselves and to apply these   
small and simple tools. The training courses became popular   
among Nestlé's employees, increased the number of   
managers accustomed to analytic decision making, and   
established new reporting protocols imposing the use of   
analytic models.

A Total Cost Decision Model

From basic business principles, we know that the total   
cost of producing a fixed volume of a product is composed   
of fixed cost and variable cost. We also know that the   
variable cost depends on the unit variable cost as well as   
the quantity produced. The quantity produced, however,   
is a decision option because it can be controlled by the   
manager of the operation.

To develop a mathematical model, we need to specify

the precise nature of the relationships among these   
quantities. For example, we can easily state that

Total Cost

=

Fixed Cost

+

Variable Cost

Although it can be easy to develop a model from basic logic and business principles, as   
we illustrated in the previous example, most model development requires a more formal   
approach. A simple descriptive model is a visual representation called an

**influence diagram**

because it describes how various elements of the model influence, or relate to, others. An   
influence diagram is a useful approach for conceptualizing the structure of a model and   
can assist in building a mathematical or spreadsheet model. The elements of the model are   
represented by circular symbols called

*nodes*

. Arrows called

*branches*

connect the nodes

and show which elements influence others. Influence diagrams are quite useful in the early   
stages of model building when we need to understand and characterize key relationships.

E X A M P L E

11.2

Developing a Decision Model Using an Influence Diagram

We will develop a decision model for predicting profit in   
the face of uncertain future demand using an influence   
diagram, which is shown in [Figure 11.1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#410). We all know that   
profit depends on both revenues and costs. Thus, at the   
top of the influence diagram we see that both revenue and   
cost influence profit. Using some basic business logic,   
we can expand the influence diagram by adding more   
information. Revenue depends on the unit price and the   
quantity sold, and cost depends on the unit cost, quantity   
produced, and fixed costs of production. The quantity sold   
depends on the uncertain demand as well as the quantity   
produced, since we cannot sell more than the demand or   
the quantity produced, whichever is less. These facts are   
reflected in the influence diagram shown in [Figure 11.1](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#410). In   
this figure, all the nodes that have no branches pointing   
into them are inputs to the model. Unit price, unit cost, and   
fixed cost are data inputs; demand is an uncertain input,   
and the quantity produced is a decision option because   
it can be controlled by the manager of the operation.   
Profit is the output (note that it has no branches pointing   
out of it) that we wish to calculate. Any nodes that have   
arrows pointing both in and out of them are intermediate

calculations that link the inputs with the output and can be   
considered as "building blocks" of the model.

The next step is to translate the influence diagram into

a more formal model using the following definitions:

P

=

profit

R

=

revenue

C

=

cost

p

=

unit price

c

=

unit cost

F

=

fixed cost

S

=

quantity sold

Q

=

quantity produced

D

=

demand

A logical approach is to work down in the influence   
diagram starting from the output. First, profit =   
revenue - cost; thus,

P

=

R

-

C

Next, revenue equals the unit price (p) multiplied by the   
quantity sold (S):

R

=

p

\*

S

Logic also suggests that the variable cost is the unit vari-  
able cost times the quantity produced. Thus,

Variable Cost

=

Unit Variable Cost

\*

Quantity Produced

(11.2)

[By substituting this into equation (11.1), we have](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#408)

Total Cost

=

Fixed Cost

+

Variable Cost

=

Fixed Cost

+

Unit Variable Cost

\*

Quantity Produced

(11.3)

Using these relationships, we may develop a mathemati-  
cal representation by defining symbols for each of these   
quantities:  

C

=

Total cost

V

=

Unit variable cost

F

=

Fixed cost

Q

=

Quantity produced

This results in the following model:  

C

=

F

+

VQ

(11.4)

This descriptive model can be used to evaluate the cost for   
any input value of the quantity produced.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive410.png)

Data used in models can come from existing databases and other data sources, analysis of   
historical data, or surveys, experiments, and other methods of data collection. In the profit   
model, for example, we might query accounting records for values of the unit cost and fixed   
costs. Statistical methods that we have studied are often used to estimate data required in pre-  
dictive models. For instance, we might use historical data to compute the mean demand; we   
might also use quartiles or percentiles in the model to evaluate different scenarios. The next   
example shows how we might use empirical data and line-fitting techniques to build a model.

However, even if data are not available, using a good subjective estimate is better than

sacrificing the completeness of a model that may be useful to managers.

[Model Assumptions, Complexity, and Realism](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#13)

Models cannot capture every detail of a real problem, and managers must understand   
the limitations of models and their underlying assumptions. Validity refers to how well a   
model represents reality. One approach for judging the validity of a model is to identify and   
examine the assumptions made in a model to see how they agree with our perception of the   
real world; the closer the agreement, the higher the validity. Another approach is to com-  
pare model results to observed results; the closer the agreement, the more valid the model.   
A "perfect" model corresponds to the real world in every respect; unfortunately, no such   
model has ever existed and never will, because it is impossible to include every detail of   
real life in one model. To add more realism to a model generally requires more complexity,

languages." We may creatively apply various Excel tools and capabilities to improve the   
structure and use of spreadsheet models. In this section, we discuss approaches for devel-  
oping good, useful, and correct spreadsheet models. Good spreadsheet analytic applica-  
tions should also be user-friendly; that is, it should be easy to input or change data and   
see key results, particularly for users who may not be as proficient in using spreadsheets.   
Good design reduces the potential for errors and misinterpretation of information, leading   
to more insightful decisions and better results.

Because decision models characterize the relationships between inputs and outputs, it is   
useful to separate the data, model calculations, and model outputs clearly in designing a   
spreadsheet. It is particularly important not to use input data in model formulas, but to ref-  
erence the spreadsheet cells that contain the data. In this way, if the data change or if you   
want to experiment with the model, you need not change any of the formulas, which can   
easily result in errors. We illustrate these concepts in the following example.

Spreadsheet Implementation of the Profit Model

The analytical model we developed in[Example 11.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#409) can   
easily be implemented in an Excel spreadsheet to evaluate   
profit (Excel file

400,000,

and demand

=

50,000. For the purposes of building

a spreadsheet model, we assume that the quantity   
produced is 40,000 units, although as we have noted,   
this is a decision option that can be changed. [Figure 11.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#412)shows a spreadsheet implementation of this model. To   
better understand the model, study the relationships   
between the spreadsheet formulas, the influence   
diagram, and the mathematical model. Observe the

correspondence between the spreadsheet formulas and   
the model, for instance:

Profit (cell C22)

=

Revenue

-

Variable Cost

-

Fixed Cost

=

C15

-

C19

-

C20

Thus, if you can write a spreadsheet formula, you can   
develop a mathematical model by substituting symbols or   
numbers into the Excel formulas. Notice also how the data   
are separated from the model and referenced in the model   
formulas. A manager might use the spreadsheet to evalu-  
ate how profit would be expected to change for different   
values of the uncertain future demand and/or the quantity   
produced. We do this later in this chapter.

Chapter 11

Spreadsheet Modeling and Analysis

There are often many options when implementing a model on a spreadsheet. It is

important to keep the end user in mind and format the spreadsheet model in a form that   
he or she---who may be a financial manager, for example---can easily interpret and use. In   
the following example, we show three different ways of implementing a financial model to   
illustrate this issue.

Modeling Net Income on a Spreadsheet

The calculation of net income is based on the following   
formulas:

■

■

gross profit

=

sales

-

cost of goods sold

■

■

operating expenses

=

administrative expenses

+

selling expenses

+

depreciation expenses

-

operating expenses

■

■

earnings before taxes

-

interest expense

■

=

earnings before taxes

-

We could develop a simple model to compute net

income using these formulas by substitution:

net income

=

sales

-

cost of goods sold

-

administrative

expenses

-

selling expenses

-

depreciation

expenses

-

interest expense

-

We can implement this model on a spreadsheet, as

[shown in Figure 11.4. This spreadsheet provides only the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#413)

end result and, from a financial perspective, provides little   
information to the end user.

An alternative is to break down the model by

writing the preceding formulas in separate cells in the   
spreadsheet using a data-model format, as shown in   
[Figure 11.5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#414) This clearly shows the individual calculations   
and provides better information. However, although both   
of these models are technically correct, neither is in the   
form to which most accounting and financial employees   
are accustomed.

A third alternative is to express the calculations

as a

pro forma income statement

using the structure

and formatting that accountants are used to, as shown   
in [Figure 11.6](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#414). Although this has the same calculations   
as in [Figure 11.5,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#414) note that the use of negative dollar   
amounts requires a change in the formulas (that is,   
addition of negative amounts rather than subtraction   
of positive amounts). The Excel workbook

Net Income

Models

contains each of these examples in separate

worksheets.

Building spreadsheet models, often called

**spreadsheet engineering**

, is part art and part

science. The quality of a spreadsheet can be assessed by both its logical accuracy and its   
design. Spreadsheets need to be accurate, understandable, and user-friendly.

First and foremost, spreadsheets should be accurate.

**Verification**

is the process of

ensuring that a model is accurate and free from logical errors. Spreadsheet errors can be

disastrous. A large investment company once made a $2.6 billion error. They notified holders   
of one mutual fund to expect a large dividend; fortunately, they caught the error before send-  
ing the checks. One research study of 50 spreadsheets found that fewer than 10% were error   
free.

3

Significant errors in business have resulted from mistakes in copying and pasting, sort-

ing, numerical input, and spreadsheet formula references. Industry research has found that   
more than 90% of spreadsheets with more than 150 rows were incorrect by at least 5%.

There are three basic approaches to spreadsheet engineering that can improve spread-

sheet quality:

**1.**

*Improve the design and format of the spreadsheet itself.*

After the inputs, out-

puts, and key model relationships are well understood, you should sketch a   
logical design of the spreadsheet. For example, you might want the spread-  
sheet to resemble a financial statement to make it easier for managers to read.   
It is good practice to separate the model inputs from the model itself and to   
reference the input cells in the model formulas; that way, any changes in the

Spreadsheet Modeling and Analysis

inputs will be automatically reflected in the model. We have done this in the   
examples.

Another useful approach is to break complex formulas into smaller pieces. We

also did this in the previous examples. This reduces typographical errors, makes it   
easier to check your results, and makes the spreadsheet easier to read for the user.

**2.**

*Improve the process used to develop a spreadsheet.*

If you sketched out a concep-

tual design of the spreadsheet, work on each part individually before moving on   
to the others to ensure that each part is correct. As you enter formulas, check the   
results with simple numbers (such as 1) to determine if they make sense, or use   
inputs with known results. Be careful in using the

*Copy*

and

*Paste*

commands in

Excel, particularly with respect to relative and absolute addresses. Use the Excel   
function wizard (the

*f*

*x*

button on the formula bar) to ensure that you are entering

the correct values in the correct fields of the function.

**3.**

*Inspect your results carefully, and use appropriate tools available in Excel.*

For example, the Excel

*Formula Auditing*

tools (in the

*Formulas*

tab) help you

validate the logic of formulas and check for errors. Using

*Trace Precedents*

and

*Trace Dependents*

, you can visually show what cells affect or are affected

by the value of a selected cell, similar to an influence diagram. The

*Formula*

*Auditing*

tools also include

*Error Checking*

, which checks for common errors

that occur when using formulas, and

*Evaluate Formula*

, which helps to debug

a complex formula by evaluating each part of the formula individually. We   
encourage you to learn how to use these tools.

Other Excel tools that can be used to improve the quality and user-friendliness of

spreadsheet models include range names and form controls, both of which were introduced   
[in Chapter 2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#76)

[Data Validation](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#13)

One useful Excel tool is the

**data validation**

feature, which allows you to define acceptable

input values in a spreadsheet and provides an error alert if an invalid entry is made. This   
can help you avoid inadvertent user errors. This feature can be found in the

*Data Tools*

group within the

*Data*

tab on the Excel ribbon. Select the cell range, click on

*Data Valida-*

*tion*

, and then specify the criteria that Excel will use to flag invalid data.

how the IF function is used in cell B20 to identify the best   
decision. If the cost difference is negative or zero, then   
the function returns "Manufacture" as the best decision;   
otherwise, it returns "Outsource."

Suppose that you are asked to use the spreadsheet

to evaluate the manufacturing and purchase cost options   
and best decisions for a large number of parts used in   
an automobile system assembly. You are given lists of   
data that cost accountants and purchasing managers   
have compiled and printed and must look up the data and   
enter them into the spreadsheet. Such a manual process

leaves plenty of opportunity for error. However, suppose   
that we know that the unit cost of any item is at least $10   
but no more than $100. If a cost is $47.50, for instance,   
a misplaced decimal would result in either $4.75 or $475,   
which would clearly be out of range. In the

A wide variety of practical problems in business analytics can be modeled using spread-  
sheets. In this section, we present several examples of descriptive modeling applica-  
tions. These models allow one to answer questions such as "How many resources do

In the mid-1980s, Procter \& Gamble (P\&G) needed an

easy and consistent way to manage safety stock inven-

tory. P\&G's Western European Business Analysis group

created a spreadsheet model that eventually grew into a

suite of global inventory models. The model was designed

to help supply chain planners better understand invento-

ries in supply chains and to provide a quick method for

setting safety stock levels. P\&G also developed several

spin-off models based on this application that are used

around the world.

In designing the model, analysts used many of the

principles of spreadsheet engineering. For example, they

separated the input sections from the calculation and

results sections by grouping the appropriate cells and

using different formatting. This speeded up the data entry

process. In addition, the spreadsheet was designed to dis-

play all relevant data on one screen so the user does not

need to switch between different sections of the model.

Analysts used a combination of data validation and

conditional formatting to highlight errors in the data input.

They also provided a list of warnings and errors that a user

should resolve before using the results of the model. The list

flags obvious mistakes such as negative transit times, input

data that may require checking, and forecast errors that fall

outside the boundaries of the model's statistical validity.

At the basic level, all input fields had comments

attached; this served as a quick online help function for the

planners. For each model, they also provided a user manual

that describes every input and result and explains the for-

mulas in detail. The model templates and all documentation

were posted on an intranet site that was accessible to all

P\&G employees. This ensured that all employees had access

to the most current versions of the models, supporting mate-

rial, and training schedules.

Staffing is an area of any business where making changes can be expensive and   
time- consuming. Thus, it is important to understand staffing requirements well in advance.   
The time it takes to hire and train new employees can be 90 to 180 days, so it is not always   
possible to react quickly to staffing needs. Hence, advance planning is vital so that man-  
agers can make good decisions about overtime or reductions in work hours, or adding or   
reducing temporary or permanent staff. Planning for staffing requirements is an area where   
analytics can be of tremendous benef[it. Example 11.7 is adapted from a real appl](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#418)ication in

The author is indebted to Mr. Craig Zielazny of BlueNote Analytics, LLC, for providing this example.

Suppose that the manager of a loan-processing   
department wants to know how many employees will be   
needed over the next several months to process a certain   
number of loan files per month so she can better plan   
capacity. Let's also suppose that there are different types   
of products that require processing. A product could be   
a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, a 7/1 ARM, an FHA loan,   
or a construction loan. Each of these loan types vary in   
their complexity, require different levels of documentation,   
and, consequently, have different times to complete.   
Assume that the manager forecasts 700 loan applications   
in May, 750 in June, 800 in July, and 825 in August. Each   
employee works productively for 6.5 hours each day, and   
there are 22 working days in May, 20 in June, 22 in July,   
and 22 in August. The manager also knows, based on   
historical loan data, the percentage of each product type   
and how long it takes to process one loan of each type.   
These data are as follows:

The manager would like to determine the number

of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff needed each month to   
ensure that all loans can be processed.

[Figure 11.10 shows a simple descriptive model on](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#419)

a spreadsheet to calculate the FTEs required (Excel file

). For each month, we take the desired

throughput and convert this to the number of files for   
each product based on the product mix percentages.   
By multiplying by the hours per file, we then calculate the   
number of hours required for each product. Finally, we   
divide the total number of hours required each month by   
the number of working hours each month (hours worked   
per day

decide on how many special holiday gift boxes to assemble. The general scenario is com-  
monly known as the

**newsvendor problem**

: A street newsvendor sells daily newspapers

and must make a decision about how many to purchase. Purchasing too few results in lost   
opportunity to increase profits, but purchasing too many results in a loss since the excess   
must be discarded at the end of the day.

We first develop a general model for this problem and then illustrate it with an exam-

ple. Let us assume that each item costs

*C*

to purchase and is sold for

*R*

. At the end of the

period, any unsold items can be disposed of at

*S*

each (the salvage value). Clearly, it makes

sense to assume that

*R*

7

*C*

7

*S*

. Let

*D*

be the number of units demanded during the

period and

*Q*

be the quantity purchased. Note that

*D*

is an uncontrollable input, whereas

*Q*

is a decision variable. If demand is known, then the optimal decision is obvious: Choose

*Q*

=

*D*

. However, if

*D*

is not known in advance, we run the risk of overpurchasing or

underpurchasing. If

*Q*

6

*D*

, then we lose the opportunity of realizing additional profit

(since we assume that

*R*

7

*C*

), and if

*Q*

7

*D*

, we incur a loss (because

*C*

7

*S*

).

Notice that we cannot sell more than the minimum of the actual demand and the

amount produced. Thus, the quantity sold at the regular price is the smaller of

*D*

and

*Q*

.

Also, the surplus quantity is the larger of 0 and

An important operations decision for service businesses such as hotels, airlines, and car-rental   
companies is the number of reservations to accept to effectively fill capacity, knowing that   
some customers may not use their reservations or tell the business. If a hotel, for example,   
holds rooms for customers who do not show up, they lose revenue opportunities. (Even if   
they charge a night's lodging as a guarantee, rooms held for additional days may go unused.)   
A common practice in these industries is

**overbooking**

reservations; that is, to take more res-

ervations than can be handled, with the expectation that some customers will cancel. When   
more customers arrive than can be handled, the business usually incurs some cost to satisfy   
them (by putting them up at another hotel or, for most airlines, providing extra compensation   
such as ticket vouchers). Therefore, the decision becomes how much to overbook to balance   
the costs of overbooking against the lost revenue for underuse. The following example illus-  
trates a model to evaluate the net revenue under different scenarios and overbooking policies.

Hotel

Overbooking Model

) for a popular resort hotel that has 300

rooms and is usually fully booked. The hotel charges $120   
per room. Reservations may be canceled by the 6:00 p.m.   
deadline with no penalty. The hotel has estimated that the   
average overbooking cost is $100.

The logic of the model is straightforward. In the

model section of the spreadsheet, cell B11 represents the   
decision variable of how many reservations to accept, in   
this case, 310. In this example, we assume that the hotel is   
willing to accept 310 reservations; that is, to overbook by   
10 rooms. Cell B12 represents the actual customer demand   
(the number of customers who want a reservation). Here   
we assume that 312 customers tried to make a reservation.   
The hotel cannot accept more reservations than its   
predetermined limit; therefore, the number of reservations   
made in cell B13 is the smaller of the customer demand and

the reservation limit. Cell B14 is the number of customers   
who decide to cancel their reservation. In this example, we   
assume that only 6 of the 310 reservations are cancelled.   
Therefore, the actual number of customers who arrive (cell   
B15) is the difference between the number of reservations   
made and the number of cancellations. If the actual   
number of customer arrivals exceeds the room capacity,   
overbooking occurs. This is modeled by the MAX function   
in cell B17. Net revenue is computed in cell B18. A manager   
would probably want to use this model to analyze how the   
number of overbooked customers and net revenue would   
be influenced by changes in the reservation limit, customer   
demand, and cancellations.

As with the newsvendor model, the customer demand

and the number of cancellations are random variables that   
we cannot specify with certainty. We also show how to   
incorporate randomness into the model in the next chapter.

Modeling Retail Markdown Pricing Decisions

A chain of department stores is introducing a new   
brand of bathing suit for $70. The prime selling season   
is 50 days during the late spring and early summer;   
after that, the store has a clearance sale around July 4   
and marks down the price by 70% (to $21.00), typically   
selling any remaining inventory at the clearance price.   
Merchandise buyers have purchased 1,000 units and   
allocated them to the stores prior to the selling season.   
After a few weeks, the stores reported an average sales   
of 7 units/day, and past experience suggests that this   
constant level of sales will continue over the remainder of   
the selling season. Thus, over the 50-day selling season,

the stores would be expected to sell 50

Patient volume consists almost

entirely of scheduled appointments for non-urgent health   
care needs. In a recent academic year, 35,050 appoint-  
ments were scheduled. Patients failed to arrive for over   
10% of these appointments. The no-show problem is not   
unique. Various studies report that no-show rates for health   
service providers often range as high as 30% to 50%.

To address this problem, a quality-improvement (QI)

team was formed to analyze an overbooking option. Their   
efforts resulted in developing a novel overbooking model   
that included the effects of employee burnout result-  
ing from the need to see more patients than the normal   
capacity allowed. The model provided strong evidence   
that a 10% to 15% overbooking level produces the high-  
est value. The overbooking model was also instrumental   
in alleviating staff concerns about disruption and pres-  
sures that result from large numbers of overscheduled   
patients. At a 5% overbooking rate, the staff was reas-  
sured by model results that predicted 95% of the oper-

worst case, eight patients would be overscheduled a few   
days each month. In addition, at a 10% overbooking rate, the   
model predicted that during 85% of the operating days per   
month, no patients would be overscheduled; a maximum of   
16 overscheduled patients would rarely occur.

Based on the model, the SHS implemented an overbook-

ing policy and overbooked by 7.3% with plans to increase to   
10% in future semesters. The SHS director estimated that the   
savings from overbooking during the first semester of imple-  
mentation would be approximately $95,000.

Predictive models focus on understanding the future. Practical business models focus on   
predicting financial performance such as profitability or cash flow, customer retention,   
product sales, and many other key metrics. Individuals often use spreadsheet models for   
financial planning, personal budgets, and so on. Such models usually involve multiple time

New-Product Development

Suppose that Moore Pharmaceuticals has discovered a   
potential drug breakthrough in the laboratory and needs   
to decide whether to conduct clinical trials and seek FDA   
approval to market the drug. Total R\&D costs are expected   
to reach $700 million, and the cost of clinical trials will be   
about $150 million. The current market size is estimated   
to be two million people and is expected to grow at a rate   
of 3% each year. In the first year, Moore estimates gaining   
an 8% market share, which is anticipated to grow by   
20% each year. It is difficult to estimate beyond five years   
because new competitors are expected to be entering the   
market. A monthly prescription is anticipated to generate   
revenue of $130 while incurring variable costs of $40.   
A discount rate of 9% is assumed for computing the net   
present value of the project. The company needs to know   
how long it will take to recover its fixed expenses and the   
net present value over the first five years.

situation (Excel file

Moore Pharmaceuticals

). The model

is based on a variety of known data, estimates, and

assumptions. If you examine the model closely, you will see   
that some of the inputs in the model are easily obtained   
from corporate accounting (for example, discount rate, unit   
revenue, and unit cost) using historical data (for example,   
project costs), forecasts, or judgmental estimates based   
on preliminary market research or previous experience (for   
example, market size, market share, and yearly growth   
rates). The model itself is a straightforward application of   
accounting and financial logic; you should examine the   
Excel formulas to see how the model is built.

The assumptions used represent the "most likely"

estimates, and the spreadsheet shows that the product   
will begin to be profitable by the fourth year. However, the   
model is based on some rather tenuous assumptions about   
the market size and market-share growth rates. In reality,   
much of the data used in the model are uncertain, and the   
corporation would be remiss if it simply used the results of   
this one scenario. The real value of the model would be in   
analyzing a variety of scenarios that use different values for   
these assumptions.

Cash Budget Model

). The budget

begins in April; thus, the sales for April and subsequent   
months are forecast values. On average, 20% of sales are   
collected in the month of sale, 50% in the month following   
the sale, and 30% in the second month following the sale   
(see cells B7:B9). For example, in the figure in column E,   
$120,000 is collected on April sales, $250,000 on March   
sales, and $120,000 on February sales. Purchases are   
60% of sales and are paid for one month prior to the sale.   
Wages and salaries are 12% of sales and are paid in the   
same month as the sale. Rent of $10,000 is paid each   
month. Additional cash operating expenses of $30,000 per

month will be incurred for April through July, decreasing   
to $25,000 for August and September. Tax payments   
of $20,000 and $30,000 are expected in April and July,   
respectively. A capital expenditure of $150,000 will occur   
in June, and the company has a mortgage payment of   
$60,000 in May. The cash balance at the end of March   
is $150,000, and managers want to maintain a minimum   
balance of $100,000 at all times. The company will borrow   
the amounts necessary to ensure that the minimum balance   
is achieved. Any cash above the minimum will be used to   
pay off any loan balance until it is eliminated. The available   
cash balances in row 25 of the spreadsheet are the outputs   
the company wants to predict.

A Retirement-Planning Model

A student who is completing her MBA has accepted a job   
with a starting salary of $80,000. The company will match   
up to 5% of pre-tax salary under their 401(k) retirement   
plan. She expects her salary to increase on average 4%   
each year, and plans to contribute 15% of her pre-tax   
income to her 401(k) account, up to the annual cap of   
$18,000. She has chosen to invest in two aggressive   
mutual funds: the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, which   
has less risk, for her 401(k), and the Boston Trust Asset   
Management Fund for a Roth IRA. Based on a ten-year   
average return, she expects the Vanguard fund to earn 6%   
each year and the Boston Trust fund to earn 6.5% each   
year. Currently, individuals can contribute up to $18,000 of   
pre-tax income annually into a 401(k) account; individuals   
under age 55 can contribute $5,500 to their Roth IRA   
annually; and individuals 55 and over can contribute $6,500   
into a Roth IRA. She hopes to retire at 60 and wants to   
predict the value of her retirement investments.

scenario (Excel file

Retirement Planning Model

). Several key

assumptions have been made in developing this model.   
One, of course, is that the annual salary increase and   
returns on investment will be the same each year. In reality,   
these values will be uncertain and vary randomly each   
year (and investment returns can be negative). A second   
assumption is how the model calculates the return on   
investment. The annual returns assume that the investment   
return is applied to the previous year's balance and not   
to the current year's contributions (examine the formulas   
in columns H and I). An alternative would be to calculate   
the investment return based on the end-of-year balance,   
including current-year contributions. This will produce a   
different result. In reality, neither of these are quite correct,   
since the 401(k) contributions would normally be made on a   
monthly basis. Reflecting this would require a much larger   
and more complex spreadsheet model.

Project management is concerned with scheduling the activities of a project involv-  
ing interrelated activities. An important aspect of project management is predicting the   
expected completion time of the project. To do this, we first define the set of activities that   
comprise the project, the time it takes for each activity, and the predecessors of each activ-  
ity (those activities that must immediately precede it). These precedence relationships are

usually depicted as a network. The longest path through the network defines the minimum   
project completion time and is called the

**critical path**

. To find the critical path, we first

compute the earliest time that each activity can start and the earliest time it can finish. The   
earliest time that the last activity can finish is the minimum project completion time. Then   
we find the latest time each activity can start and the latest time that it can finish without   
delaying the project. The difference between the latest finish time and earliest finish time is   
called the

**slack**

as the early start time plus the activity time. The earliest   
finish time for the last activity, Q (cell D21, copied to   
cell F23), represents the earliest time the project can be   
completed, that is, the minimum project completion time.

To compute latest start and latest finish times, we set

the latest finish time of the last activity equal to the project   
completion time. The latest start time is computed by   
subtracting the activity time from the latest finish time. The   
latest finish time for any other activity, say X, is defined as   
the

minimum

latest start of all activities for which activity

X is an immediate predecessor. Slack is computed as the   
difference between the latest finish and earliest finish times.   
The critical path consists of activities with zero slack. Based   
on the expected activity times, the critical path consists   
of activities B-F-G-H-I-K-M-O-P-Q and has a predicted   
duration of 159 days.

Becker Consulting has been hired to assist in the

We introduced prescriptiv[e models in Chapter 1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30) Recall that a prescriptive decision model   
helps decision makers to identify the best solution to a decision problem. Prescriptive mod-  
els are often called

*optimization models*

. An optimization model is most often formulated

mathematically and specifies a set of

*decision variables*

, numerical quantities that repre-

sent the decision options from which to choose; an

*objective function*

that minimizes or

maximizes some quantity of interest, profit, revenue, cost, time, and so on; and

*constraints*

,

which are limitations, requirements, or other restrictions that are imposed on any solu-  
tion. We will study the mathematical formulation and solution techniques for optimization   
[problems in Chapters 13--15.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494) Here we focus on building spreadsheet models that capture   
these model elements.

Selecting investment portfolios is fundamentally a trade-off between return and risk.   
Clearly, a major source of uncertainty is the annual return of each asset, leaving the deci-  
sion maker with the risk of not achieving a desired return. In addition, the decision maker   
faces other risks---for example, unanticipated changes in inflation or industrial production,   
the spread between high- and low-grade bonds, and the spread between long- and short-  
term interest rates.

One approach to incorporating such risk factors in a decision model is

**arbitrate**

**pricing theory (APT)**

.

9

APT provides estimates of the sensitivity of a particular asset

to these types of risk factors, leading to a prescriptive model for finding the best   
portfolio mix.

Let us assume that the risk factors per dollar allocated

to each asset have been determined as follows:

Investment

Risk Factor/Dollar Invested

1. Life insurance

-

0.5

2. Bond mutual funds

1.8

3. Stock mutual funds

2.1

4. Savings account

-

0.3

The investor may specify a target level for the weighted

risk factor, thus leading to a constraint that limits the risk to   
the desired level. For example, suppose that our investor   
will tolerate a weighted risk per dollar invested of at most   
1.0. Then the weighted risk for a $100,000 total investment   
will be limited to 100,000. If our investor allocates $5,000   
in life insurance, $50,000 in bond mutual funds, $15,000 in   
stock mutual funds, and $30,000 in a savings account, the   
total expected annual return would be

Expected Annual Return

=

0.05($5,000)

+

0.07($50,000)

+

0.11($15,000)

+

0.04($30,000)

=

$6,600

However, the total weighted risk associated with this

solution is

Total Weighted Risk

=

-

0.5(5,000)

+

1.8(50,000)

+

2.1(15,000)

-

0.3(30,000)

=

110,000

Because this is greater than the limit of 100,000,

this solution could not be chosen. The decision problem,   
then, is to determine how much to invest in each asset to   
maximize the total expected annual return, remain within   
the minimum and maximum limits for each investment, and   
meet the limitation on the weighted risk.

A spreadsheet for this problem is shown in [Figure 11.19](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#431)

(Excel file

). Problem data are

specified in rows 4 through 10. On the bottom half of the   
spreadsheet, we specify the amounts invested (decision   
options) in cells B16:B19, all of which must add up to   
$100,000; the total expected return (objective function) in cell   
B24, which is the formula

=

SUMPRODUCT(B6:B9,B16:B19);

and the total amount invested and total weighted risk   
(constraints) in cells B21 and B22. Note that the formulas   
used in cells B24 and B22 \[

=

SUMPRODUCT(E6:E9,B16:B19)\]

A common problem in designing service systems is to locate a facility in a "central" loca-  
tion with respect to other facilities to minimize some measure of distance from the central   
location to each of the other facilities. Distances can be measured in several ways. Suppose   
that the

-coordinates of two locations are (

*X*

,

*Y*

) and (

). One measure is the

straight-line distance between the points. This is computed as

**Euclidian distance**

. A second measure of distance is

called

**rectilinear distance**

, which is computed as

the volume, or frequency, of trips between locations. The goal is to find the location for the

A medical testing laboratory needs to collect blood samples   
from several regional hospitals to perform diagnostic   
testing. Currently, the laboratory is in the middle of a small   
town, but several new hospitals have been constructed   
in outlying areas. The lab wants to relocate to reduce the   
travel distance required to pick up the samples. The

X

- and

-coordinates for the hospital locations have been found

on a grid. The following table shows these, along with the

A unique application of Excel modeling is for job-sequencing problems. Job-sequencing   
problems involve finding an optimal sequence, or order, by which to process a set of jobs.   
For any job sequence, we may compute the completion time for each job by successively   
adding the processing times of that job and all that were completed before it. We may then   
compare the completion times with the requested due dates to determine if the job is com-  
pleted either early or late. For any job

*i*

,

*lateness*

(

*L*

*i*

) is the difference between the comple-

tion time (

*C*

*i*

) and the due date (

*D*

*i*

), which can be either positive or negative.

*Tardiness*

(

*T*

*i*

)

is the amount of time by which the completion time exceeds the due date; thus, tardiness is   
zero if a job is completed early. Hence, for job

*i*

,

*L*

*i*

=

*C*

-

*D*

*i*

**(11.9)**

*T*

*i*

=

max(0,

*L*

*i*

)

**(11.10)**

Researchers have shown that sequencing jobs in order of shortest processing time (SPT) first   
will minimize the average completion time for all jobs. Sequencing by earliest due date (EDD)   
first will minimize the maximum number of tardy jobs. However, the manager might be inter-  
ested in minimizing other criteria, such as the average tardiness, total tardiness, or total lateness.

) and a portion of the Excel formulas. A

particular job sequence (the decision options) is given in   
row 10; for this example, we show the sequence for the   
EDD rule. In rows 11 and 13, we use the INDEX function

to identify the processing time and due date associated   
with a specific job. For example, the formula in cell B11 is   
=INDEX($B$4:$K$6, 2, B10). This function references the   
value in the second row of the range B4:K6 corresponding to   
the job assigned to cell B10, in this case, job 5. Likewise, the   
formula in cell B13, =INDEX($B$4:$K$6, 3, B10), finds the   
due date associated with job 5. Any sequence of integers in   
the decision variable range is called a

permutation

. The goal

is to find a permutation that optimizes the chosen criterion.

Because predictive analytical models are based on assumptions and incorporate data that   
most likely are not known with certainty or are subject to error, it is usually important to   
investigate how these assumptions and uncertainty affect the model outputs. This is one of   
the most important and valuable activities for using spreadsheet models to gain insights and   
make good decisions. In this section, we describe several different approaches for doing this.

Spreadsheet models allow you to easily evaluate what-if questions---how specific combi-  
nations of inputs that reflect key assumptions will affect model outputs.

**What-if analysis**

is as easy as changing values in a spreadsheet and recalculating the outputs. However,   
systematic approaches make this process easier and more useful.

[In Example 11.2, we de](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#409)veloped a spreadsheet model for profit and suggested how a

manager might use the model to change inputs and evaluate different scenarios. A more   
informative way of evaluating a wider range of scenarios is to build a table in the spread-  
sheet to vary the input or inputs in which we are interested over some range and calculate   
the output for this range of values. The following example illustrates this.

Using Excel for What-If Analysis

In the profit model used in [Example 11.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#409), we stated that   
demand is uncertain. A manager might be interested in   
the following question: For any fixed quantity produced,   
how will profit change as demand changes? In[Figure
11.23,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#436) we created a table for varying levels of demand and   
computed the profit. This shows that a loss is incurred   
for low levels of demand, whereas profit is limited to   
$240,000 whenever the demand exceeds the quantity   
produced, no matter how high it is. Notice that the formula

refers to cells in the model; thus, the user could change   
the quantity produced or any of the other model inputs   
and still have a correct evaluation of the profit for these   
values of demand. One of the advantages of evaluating   
what-if questions for a range of values rather than one   
at a time is the ability to visualize the results in a chart,   
as shown in [Figure 11.24](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#436). This clearly shows that profit   
increases as demand increases until it hits the value of the   
quantity produced.

Conducting what-if analysis in this fashion can be quite tedious. Fortunately, Excel

provides several tools---

*Data Tables*

,

*Scenario Manager*

, and

*Goal Seek*

---that facilitate

what-if and other types of decision model analyses. These can be found within the

variable over a range of values for a single input variable.

**Two-way data tables**

evaluate

an output variable over a range of values for two different input variables.

To create a one-way data table, first create a range of values for some input cell in your

model that you wish to vary. The input values must be listed either down a column (column   
oriented) or across a row (row oriented). If the input values are column oriented, enter the   
cell reference for the output variable in your model that you wish to evaluate in the row

*above*

the first value and one cell to the

*right*

of the column of input values. Reference any

other output variable cells to the right of the first formula. If the input values are listed across   
a row, enter the cell reference of the output variable in the column to the

*left*

of the first

value and one cell

*below*

the row of values. Type any additional output cell references below

the first one. Next, select the range of cells that contains

*both*

the formulas and values you

want to substitute. From the

*Data*

tab in Excel, select

*Data Table*

under the

*What-If Analy-*

*sis*

menu. In the dialog box (see[Figure 11.25](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#437)), if the input range is column oriented, type

the cell reference for the input cell in your model in the

*Column input cell*

box. If the input

range is row oriented, type the cell reference for the input cell in the

*Row input cell*

box.

A One-Way Data Table for Uncertain Demand

In this example, we create a one-way data table for profit   
for varying levels of demand. First, create a column of   
[demand values in column E exactly as we did in Example
11.18. Then in cell F3, enter the formula](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#435)

=

C22. This simply

references the output of the profit model. Highlight the   
range E3:F11 (note that this range includes both the column

of demand as well as the cell reference to profit), and select

Data Table

from the

What-If Analysis

menu. In the

Column

input cell

field, enter B8; this tells the tool that the values

in column E are different values of demand in the model.   
When you click

OK

, the tool produces the results (which we

[formatted as currency) shown in Figure 11.26.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#438)

One-Way Data Tables with Multiple Outputs

Suppose that we want to examine the impact of the   
uncertain demand on revenue in addition to profit. We   
simply add another column to the data table. For this case,   
insert the formula

=

C15 into cell G3. Also, add the labels

"Profit" in F2 and "Revenue" in G2 to identify the results.   
Then highlight the range E3:G11 and proceed as described   
in the previous example. This process results in the data   
[table shown in Figure 11.27.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#438)

We may evaluate multiple outputs using one-way data tables.

A Two-Way Data Table for the Profit Model

In most models, the assumptions used for the input data are   
often uncertain. For example, in the profit model, the unit cost   
might be affected by supplier price changes and inflationary   
factors. Marketing might be considering price adjustments to   
meet profit goals. We use a two-way data table to evaluate the   
impact of changing these assumptions. First, create a column   
for the unit prices you wish to evaluate and a row for the unit   
costs in the form of a matrix (see column E and row 2 in [Figure
11.28](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#438)). In the upper left corner (which is cell E2 in [Figure 11.28)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#438),

enter the formula

=

C22, which references the profit in the

model. Select the range of all the data (not including the   
descriptive titles; that is, E2:I13 in[Figure 11.28)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#438) and then   
select the data table tool in the

What-If Analysis

menu. In the

Data Table

dialog, enter B6 for the

Row input cell

since the

unit cost corresponds to cell B6 in the model, and enter B5 for   
the

Column input cell

since the unit price corresponds to cell

B5. [Figure 11.28](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#439) shows the completed result as a heat map,   
using conditional formatting color scales (see[Chapter 3)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#114).

scenario in the

*Scenario name*

box. In the

rated by commas, for the cells in your model that you want to include in the scenario (or   
hold down the Ctrl key and click on the cells). In the

*Scenario Values*

dialog that appears

next, enter values for each of the changing cells. If you have put these into your spread-  
sheet, you can simply reference them. After all scenarios are added, they can be selected by   
clicking on the name of the scenario and then the

*Show*

button. Excel will change all values

of the cells in your spreadsheet to correspond to those defined by the scenario for you to see   
the results within the model. When you click the

*Summary*

button on the

*Scenario Manager*

dialog, you will be prompted to enter the result cells and choose either a summary or a Piv-  
otTable report. The

*Scenario Manager*

can handle up to 32 variables.

The

*Scenario Manager*

is a useful tool for

**best-case/worst-case analysis**

. For exam-

ple, in the profit model, a best-case scenario would be a high unit price, low unit and fixed   
cost, and high demand, while a worst-case scenario would have a low unit price, high unit   
and fixed cost, and low demand.

Finding the Break-Even Point in the Outsourcing Model

In the outsourcing decision model we introduced in

of demand volume for which total manufacturing cost   
equals total purchased cost or, equivalently, for which the   
difference is zero. Therefore, you seek to find the value of

production volume in cell B12 that yields a value of zero   
in cell B19. In the

Create a range of values for some input cell in your   
model that you wish to vary. The input values must   
be listed either down a column (column oriented)   
or across a row (row oriented). If the input values   
are column oriented, enter the cell reference for   
the output variable in your model that you wish   
to evaluate in the row above the first value and   
one cell to the right of the column of input values.   
Reference any other output variable cells to the   
right of the first formula. If the input values are   
listed across a row, enter the cell reference of the   
output variable in the column to the left of the first   
value and one cell below the row of values. Type   
any additional output cell references below the first   
one. Next, select the range of cells that contains   
both the formulas and values you want to substi-  
tute. From the

Modern Electronics sells two popular models of   
wireless headphones, model A and model B. The   
sales of these products are not independent of each   
other (in economics, we call these substitutable prod-  
ucts because if the price of one increases, sales of the   
other will increase). The store wishes to establish a   
pricing policy to maximize revenue from these prod-  
ucts. A study of price and sales data shows the fol-  
lowing relationships between the quantity sold (

and prices (

Few companies take the time to estimate the value of a   
good customer (and often spend little effort to keep   
one). Suppose that a customer at a restaurant spends, on   
average,

*R*

per visit and comes

*F*

times each year (for

example, if a customer purchases once every two years,   
then

*F*

=

1

∙

2

=

0.5). The restaurant realizes a gross

profit margin of

*M*

(expressed as a fraction) on the aver-

age bill for food and drinks. In addition, the fraction of   
customers defecting (not returning) each year is

*D*

.

a.

Develop a mathematical model to compute the   
gross profit during a customer's lifetime in doing   
business with the restaurant (this is often called   
the

*economic value of a customer*

).

b.

If the average purchase per visit is $50, the gross   
profit margin is 0.4 (that is, 40%), customers visit

an average of six times each year, and 30% of   
customers defect each year, what is the economic   
value of the customer?

4.

The demand for airline travel is quite sensitive to   
price. Typically, there is an inverse relationship   
between demand and price; when price decreases,   
demand increases and vice versa. One major air-  
line has found that when the price (

*P*

) for a round

trip between Chicago and Los Angeles is $600, the   
demand (

*D*

) is 500 passengers per day. When the

price is reduced to $400, demand is 1,200 passengers   
per day.

a.

Plot these points on a coordinate system and   
develop a function that relates demand to price.

b.

Develop a model that will determine the total   
revenue as a function of the price.

Based on initial

marketing studies, they believe that 35% of new pur-  
chasers in this market will ultimately try this brand,   
and of these, about 60% will purchase it in the future.   
Preliminary data also suggest that the brand will   
attract heavier-than-average buyers, such as those   
who exercise frequently and participate in sports, and   
that they will purchase about 20% more than the

A pharmaceutical company makes sales calls to phy-  
sicians to market their drugs. They want to determine   
the impact of sales calls on the profit it achieves per   
physician. The profit per physician depends on the   
number of new prescriptions that are written and the   
cost of making the sales calls. The cost of making   
the sales calls depends on the number of sales calls   
made. The number of sales calls also impacts the   
number of new prescriptions written. Construct an   
influence diagram that relates these variables.

Return on investment (ROI) is computed in the fol-  
lowing manner: ROI is equal to turnover multiplied   
by earnings as a percent of sales. Turnover is sales   
divided by total investment. Total investment is cur-  
rent assets (inventories, accounts receivable, and   
cash) plus fixed assets. Earnings equal sales minus   
the cost of sales. The cost of sales consists of variable   
production costs, selling expenses, freight and deliv-  
ery, and administrative costs.

A (greatly) simplified model of the national economy   
can be described as follows. The national income is   
the sum of three components: consumption, invest-  
ment, and government spending. Consumption is   
related to the total income of all individuals and to   
the taxes they pay on income. Taxes depend on total   
income and the tax rate. Investment is also related to   
the size of the total income.

Economists believe that housing starts depend on   
interest rates and demographic factors such as popu-  
lation size, family income, and the age of the home-  
buying population. In addition, interest rates depend   
on inflation, Federal Reserve policies, and govern-  
ment borrowing. Government borrowing depends on

government spending and tax revenues. Develop an

A clothing company is planning its winter pricing.   
One popular line of quarter-zip sweatshirts sells for   
$98. The products hit the stores at the beginning of   
September and sell through Christmas (assume 120   
days). After that time, they are discounted to $39   
for clearance and sell out. The planned inventory   
is 2,500 units. Last year, an average of 12 units per   
day were sold at the full retail price. A Columbus   
Day sale (40 days into the selling season) reduced   
the price to $79 and increased sales to an average of

Lender guidelines suggest that the allow-

able monthly housing expenditure should be no more   
than 28% of monthly gross income. From this, you   
must subtract total nonmortgage housing expenses,   
which would include insurance and property taxes   
and any other additional expenses. This defines the   
affordable monthly mortgage payment. In addition,   
guidelines also suggest that total affordable monthly   
debt payments, including housing expenses, should   
not exceed 36% of gross monthly income. This is   
calculated by subtracting total nonmortgage housing   
expenses and any other installment debt, such as car   
loans, student loans, credit card debt, and so on,   
from 36% of total monthly gross income. The   
smaller of the affordable monthly mortgage payment   
and the total affordable monthly debt payments is   
the affordable monthly mortgage. To calculate the   
maximum that can be borrowed, find the monthly   
payment per $1,000 mortgage based on the current   
interest rate and duration of the loan. Divide the   
affordable monthly mortgage amount by this   
monthly payment to find the affordable mortgage.   
Assuming a 20% down payment, the maximum price   
of a house would be the affordable mortgage divided   
by 0.8. Use the following data to test your model:

ent will decide to invest with the stockbroker's firm.   
Forty percent of those interested are found not to be   
qualified, based on the brokerage firm's screening   
criteria. The remaining are qualified. Of these, half   
will invest an average of $5,000, 25% will invest an   
average of $20,000, 15% will invest an average of   
$50,000, and the remainder will invest $100,000. The   
commission schedule is as follows:

Tanner Park is a small amusement park that provides   
a variety of rides and outdoor activities for children   
and teens. In a typical summer season, the number of   
adult and children's tickets sold is 20,000 and 10,000,   
respectively. Adult ticket prices are $18 and the chil-  
dren's price is $10. Revenue from food and beverage   
concessions is estimated to be $60,000, and souve-  
nir revenue is expected to be $25,000. Variable costs   
per person (adult or child) are $3, and fixed costs

The admissions director of an engineering college   
has $500,000 in scholarships each year from an   
endowment to offer to high-achieving applicants. The   
value of each scholarship offered is $25,000 (thus,   
20 scholarships are offered). The benefactor who   
provided the money would like to see all of it used   
each year for new students. However, not all students   
accept the money; some take offers from compet-  
ing schools. If they wait until the end of the admis-  
sion deadline to decline the scholarship, it cannot   
be offered to someone else because any other good   
students would already have committed to other pro-  
grams. Consequently, the admissions director offers   
more money than available in anticipation that a per-  
centage of offers will be declined. If more than 20   
students accept the offers, the college is committed

to honoring them, and the additional amount has to   
come out of the dean's budget. Based on prior his-  
tory, the percentage of applicants that accept the offer   
is about 70%. Develop a spreadsheet model for this   
situation to evaluate how much money must be allo-  
cated from the dean's budget based on the number of   
scholarships offered.

J\&G Bank receives an average of 30,000 credit card   
applications each month. Approximately 60% of   
them are approved. Each customer charges an aver-  
age of $2,000 to his or her credit card each month.   
Approximately 85% pay off their balances in full,   
and the remaining incur finance charges. The aver-  
age finance charge is 3.5% per month. The bank   
also receives income from fees charged for late pay-  
ments and annual fees associated with the credit   
cards. This is a percentage of total monthly charges   
and is approximately 7%. It costs the bank $20   
per application, whether it is approved or not. The   
monthly maintenance cost for credit card customers   
is $10. Finally, losses due to charge-offs of custom-  
ers' accounts average 5% of total charges. Develop   
a spreadsheet model to calculate the bank's total   
monthly profit.

With the growth of digital photography, a young   
entrepreneur is considering establishing a new busi-  
ness, Cruz Wedding Photography. He believes that   
the average number of wedding bookings per year is   
15. One of the key variables in developing his busi-  
ness plan is the life he can expect from a single digi-  
tal single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera before it needs   
to be replaced. Due to heavy usage, the shutter life   
expectancy is estimated to be 150,000 clicks. For   
each booking, the average number of photographs   
taken is assumed to be 2,000. Develop a model to   
predict the camera life (in years).

The Executive Committee of Reder Electric Vehicles   
is debating whether to replace its original model, the   
REV-Touring, with a new model, the REV-Sport, which   
would appeal to a younger audience. Whatever vehicle   
is chosen will be produced for the next four years, after   
which time a reevaluation will be necessary. The REV-  
Sport has passed through the concept and initial design   
phases and is ready for final design and manufacturing.   
Final development costs are estimated to be $75 mil-  
lion, and the new fixed costs for tooling and manufac-  
turing are estimated to be $600 million. The REV-Sport   
is expected to sell for $30,000. The first-year sales for   
the REV-Sport is estimated to be 60,000, with a sales   
growth for the subsequent years of 6% per year. The   
variable cost per vehicle is uncertain until the design   
and supply-chain decisions are finalized, but is esti-  
mated to be $22,000. Next-year sales for the REV-  
Touring are estimated to be 50,000, but the sales are   
expected to decrease at a rate of 10% for each of the   
next three years. The selling price is $28,000. Variable   
costs per vehicle are $21,000. Since the model has been   
in production, the fixed costs for development have   
already been recovered. Develop a four-year model to   
predict the profitability of each vehicle and recommend   
the best decision using a net present value discount rate   
of 5%. How sensitive is the result to the estimated vari-  
able cost of the REV-Sport? How might this affect the   
decision?

The Schoch Museum is embarking on a five-year   
fundraising campaign. As a nonprofit institution, the   
museum finds it challenging to acquire new donors,   
as many donors do not contribute every year. Suppose   
that the museum has identified a pool of 8,000 poten-  
tial donors. The actual number of donors in the first   
year of the campaign is estimated to be 60% of this   
pool. For each subsequent year, the museum expects   
that 30% of current donors will discontinue their con-  
tributions. In addition, the museum expects to attract   
some percentage of new donors. This is assumed to   
be 10% of the pool. The average contribution in the   
first year is assumed to be $50, and will increase at   
a rate of 2.5%. Develop a model to predict the total   
funds that will be raised over the five-year period.

The Hyde Park Surgery Center specializes in high-  
risk cardiovascular surgery. The center needs to   
forecast its profitability over the next three years to   
plan for capital growth projects. For the first year,   
the hospital anticipates serving 1,200 patients, which

is expected to grow by 8% per year. Based on cur-  
rent reimbursement formulas, each patient provides   
an average billing of $125,000, which will grow by   
3% each year. However, because of managed care,   
the center collects only 25% of billings. Variable   
costs for supplies and drugs are calculated to be 10%   
of billings. Fixed costs for salaries, utilities, and so   
on will amount to $20,000,000 in the first year and   
are assumed to increase by 5% per year. Develop a   
spreadsheet model to predict the net present value of   
profit over the next three years. Use a discount rate   
of 4%.

of return based on the actual funds in which you   
invest. If you are not employed, try to find informa-  
tion about salaries in the industry in which you plan   
to work and the retirement benefits that companies   
in that industry offer for your model. Estimate rates   
of returns based on popular mutual funds used for   
retirement or average performance of stock market   
indexes. Clearly state your assumptions and how you

The Gardner Theater, a community playhouse, needs   
to determine the lowest-cost production budget for an   
upcoming show. Specifically, they have to determine   
which set pieces to construct and which, if any, set   
pieces to rent from another local theater at a prede-  
termined fee. However, the organization has only two   
weeks to fully construct the set before the play goes   
into technical rehearsals. The theater has two part-time   
carpenters who work up to 12 hours a week, each at   
$10 an hour. Additionally, the theater has a part-time   
scenic artist who can work 15 hours per week to paint   
the set and props as needed at a rate of $15 per hour.   
The set design requires 20 flats (walls), two hanging   
drops with painted scenery, and three large wooden   
tables (props). The number of hours required for each   
piece for carpentry and painting is shown below:

Flats, hanging drops, and props can also be rented   
at a cost of $75, $500, and $350 each, respectively.   
The theater wants to determine how many of each   
unit should be built by the theater and how many

A gasoline mini-mart orders 25 copies of a monthly   
magazine. Depending on the cover story, demand   
for the magazine varies. The mini-mart purchases   
the magazines for $1.50 and sells them for $4.00.   
Any magazines left over at the end of the month   
are donated to hospitals and other health care facili-  
ties. Modify the newsvendor example spreadsheet to   
model this situation. Use what-if analysis to inves-

demand is expected to vary between 10 and 30 copies   
each month.

the number of rooms rented. Construct a spreadsheet   
model to determine the profit if 40 rooms are rented.   
The manager has observed that the number of rooms

Koehler Vision Associates (KVA) specializes in laser-  
assisted corrective eye surgery. Prospective patients   
make appointments for prescreening exams to deter-  
mine their candidacy for the surgery. If they qualify,   
a $250 charge is applied as a deposit for the actual   
procedure. The weekly demand is 150, and about 12%   
of prospective patients fail to show up or cancel their   
exam at the last minute. Patients who do not show up   
are refunded the prescreening fee less a $25 processing   
fee. KVA can handle 125 patients per week and is con-  
sidering overbooking its appointments to reduce the   
lost revenue associated with cancellations. However,   
any patient who is overbooked may spread unfavorable   
comments about the company; thus, the overbooking   
cost is estimated to be $125. Develop a spreadsheet   
model for calculating net revenue. Use data tables to   
study how revenue is affected by changes in the num-  
ber of appointments accepted and patient demand.

Chapter 12

Simulation and Risk Analysis

Many of the models we developed in [Chapter 11,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406) such as the newsvendor, over-

booking, and retirement-planning models, incorporated uncontrollable inputs,

such as customer demand, hotel cancellations, and annual returns on invest-

ments, which exhibit random behavior. We often assume such variables to be

constant to simplify the model and the analysis. However, many situations dictate

that randomness be explicitly incorporated into our models. This is usually done

by specifying probability distributions for the appropriate uncontrollable inputs.

As we noted earlier in this book, models that include randomness are called

sto-

chastic

, or

probabilistic

, models.

Nearly every manager deals with risk.

Risk

is the likelihood of an undesirable

outcome. It can be assessed by evaluating the probability that the outcome will

occur along with the severity of the outcome. For example, an investment that

has a high probability of losing money is riskier than one with a lower probability.

Similarly, an investment that may result in a $10 million loss is certainly riskier

than one that might result in only a $10,000 loss. In assessing risk, we could

answer questions such as, What is the probability that we will incur a financial

loss? How do the probabilities of different potential losses compare? What is the

probability that we will run out of inventory? What are the chances that a project

will be completed on time?

Risk analysis

is an approach for developing "a com-

prehensive understanding and awareness of the risk associated with a particular

variable of interest (be it a payoff measure, a cash flow profile, or a macroeco-

nomic forecast)."

1

Hertz and Thomas present a simple scenario to illustrate the

concept of risk analysis:

The executives of a food company must decide whether to launch a new pack-

aged cereal. They have come to the conclusion that five factors are the deter-

mining variables: advertising and promotion expense, total cereal market, share

of market for this product, operating costs, and new capital investment. On the

basis of the "most likely" estimate for each of these variables, the picture looks

very bright---a healthy 30% return, indicating a significantly positive expected

net present value. This future, however, depends on each of the "most likely"

estimates coming true in the actual case. If each of these "educated guesses"

has, for example, a 60% chance of being correct, there is only an 8% chance

that all five will be correct (0.60

\*

0.60

\*

0.60

\*

0.60

\*

0.60) if the factors

are assumed to be independent. So the "expected" return, or present value

measure, is actually dependent on a rather unlikely coincidence. The decision

maker needs to know a great deal more about the other values used to make

each of the five estimates and about what he stands to gain or lose from vari-

ous combinations of these values.

Thus, risk analysis seeks to examine the impacts of uncertainty in the estimates

and their potential interaction with one another on the output variable of interest.

In this chapter, we discuss how to build models involving uncertainty and

risk, and analyze them using an approach called simulation. We discuss two

types of simulation approaches: Monte-Carlo simulation and systems simula-

tion. Monte Carlo simulation is generally focused on risk analysis, particularly for

spreadsheet models. Systems simulation models dynamic systems that change

over time, such as waiting lines, inventory systems, manufacturing systems, and

so on. These techniques have wide applicability in finance and operations, as well

as other areas of business.

[Monte Carlo Simulation](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

**Monte Carlo simulation**

is the process of generating random values for uncertain inputs

in a model, computing the output variables of interest, and repeating this process for many   
trials (replications) to understand the distribution of the output results and their statistical   
properties. For example, in a predictive financial model, we might be interested in the   
distribution of the cumulative discounted cash flow over several years (the model out-  
put) when future sales, sales growth rate, operating expenses, and inflation factors (model   
inputs) are all uncertain.

In Monte Carlo simulation, we model uncertain inputs using probability distributions.

Determining the appropriate probability distributions is crucial to building good simula-  
tion models. For many uncertain inputs, empirical data may be available, either in histori-  
cal records or collected through special efforts. For example, maintenance records might   
provide data on machine failure rates and repair times, or observers might collect data   
on service times in a bank or post office. This provides a factual basis for choosing the   
appropriate probability distribution to model the input variable. We can also identify an   
appropriate distribution by fitting historical data to a theoretical model, as we illustrated   
[in Chapter 5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)

In other situations, historical data are not available, and we can draw upon the prop-

erties of common probability distributions and typical applications that we discussed in   
[Chapter 5 to help choose a representati](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)ve distribution that has the shape that would most   
reasonably represent the analyst's understanding about the uncertain variable. For exam-  
ple, a normal distribution is symmetric, with a peak in the middle. Exponential data are   
very positively skewed, with no negative values. A triangular distribution has a limited   
range and can be skewed in either direction.

In many cases, uniform or triangular distributions are used in the absence of data.

These distributions depend on simple parameters that one can easily identify based on

managerial knowledge and judgment. For example, to define the uniform distribution, we   
need to know only the smallest and largest possible values that the variable might assume.   
For the triangular distribution, we also include the most likely value. In the construction   
industry, for instance, experienced supervisors can easily tell you the fastest, most likely,   
and slowest times for performing a task such as framing a house, taking into account pos-  
sible weather and material delays, labor absences, and so on.

EXAMPLE

Profit Model

[In Chapter 11 (Example 11.4), we developed a simple](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)spreadsheet model for computing profit. The model is   
[shown again in Figure 12.1. Suppose that the demand, unit](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#455)cost, and fixed cost are uncertain. Historical data for the   
demand might suggest a probability distribution with the   
following values:

Demand

Probability

40,000

0.1

45,000

0.3

50,000

0.4

55,000

0.15

60,000

0.05

This is a simple discrete probability distribution. For

the unit cost, managers might only know that it might   
vary between $22 and $26; thus, a uniform distribution   
would be an appropriate distribution to model this. They   
might also estimate that the fixed cost might be as low as   
$350,000 or as high as $500,000, with the most likely value   
being $400,000. In this case, a triangular distribution can   
be used.

If values from these distributions are generated

randomly in the appropriate cells of the spreadsheet, the   
value of profit will also change. By repeating this many   
times, we will obtain a probability distribution of profit; this   
is the essence of Monte Carlo simulation.

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Before we learn how to implement Monte Carlo simulation on spreadsheets, we need

to introduce some key concepts and methods for generating random values from probabil-  
ity distributions in Excel.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive456.png)

The basis for generating random samples from probability distributions---which underlies   
Monte Carlo simulation---is the concept of a random number. In the context of simulation,

**random numbers**

are numbers that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Techni-

cally speaking, computers cannot generate truly random numbers since they must use a   
predictable algorithm. However, the algorithms are designed to generate a sequence of   
numbers that appear to be random. In Excel, we may generate a random number that is   
greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1 within any cell using the function RAND( ). This   
function has no arguments; therefore, nothing should be placed within the parentheses   
(but the parentheses are required). [Figure 12.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#456) shows a table of ten random numbers gen-  
erated in Excel. You should be aware that unless the automatic recalculation feature is sup-  
pressed, whenever any cell in the spreadsheet is modified, the values in any cell containing   
the RAND( ) function will change. Automatic recalculation can be changed to manual by   
choosing

*Calculation Options*

in the

*Calculation*

group under the

*Formulas*

tab. Under

manual recalculation mode, the worksheet is recalculated only when the F9 key (in Excel   
for Windows) is pressed, or the

*Calculate Now*

button in the

*Formulas*

tab is clicked.

A value randomly generated from a specified probability distribution is called a

**ran-**

**dom variate**

. Most techniques for generating random variates involve transforming ran-

dom numbers into outcomes from a probability distribution. Excel allows you to generate   
random variates from discrete distributions and certain others using the

*Random Number*

*Generation*

option in the

*Analysis Toolpak*

. ("

*Random Number Generation*

misnomer, as the tool generates random variates.) From the

*Data Analysis*

in the

group and then

*Random Number Generation*

. The

*Random Number*

*Generation*

dialog, you may select from seven distributions: uniform, normal, Bernoulli,

binomial, Poisson, patterned, and discrete. (The patterned distribution is characterized by   
a lower and upper bound, a step, a repetition rate for values, and a repetition rate for the   
sequence.) If you select the

*Output Range*

option, you are asked to specify the upper-left

cell reference of the output table that will store the outcomes, the number of variables   
(columns of values you want generated), number of random numbers (the number of data   
points you want generated for each variable), and the type of distribution. The default dis-  
tribution is the discrete distribution.

seed. A

**random number seed**

is a value from which a stream of random numbers is

generated. By specifying the same seed, you can produce the same random numbers at a   
later time. This is desirable when we wish to reproduce an identical sequence of "random"

One disadvantage with using the

tool is that it only generates

one stream of random values. This can make it difficult to use this tool to perform Monte   
Carlo simulation in spreadsheet models. We need a method to replace uncertain input data   
cells in a model with random variates. Fortunately, this can be accomplished using various   
Excel functions. In this section, we describe how to generate random variates for many   
common types of probability distributions using Excel functions.

Generating a random variate from discrete probability distributions is quite easy. We will   
illustrate this process using the probability distribution for rolling two dice.

Chapter 12

Simulation and Risk Analysis

We can easily use this approach to generate outcomes from any discrete distribution;

the VLOOKUP function in Excel can be used to implement this on a spreadsheet.

EXAMPLE

12.4

Using the VLOOKUP Function for Random Variate Generation

Suppose that we want to sample from the probability   
distribution of the predicted change in the Dow Jones   
[Industrial Average index shown in Chapter 5 in Figure 5.7.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)We first construct the cumulative distribution

F

(

x

). Then

assign intervals to the outcomes based on the values   
[of the cumulative distribution, as shown in Figure 12.5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#459)This specifies the table range for the VLOOKUP function,   
namely, $E$2:$G$10. List the random numbers in a   
column using the RAND( ) function. The formula in cell J2   
is

=

VLOOKUP(I2, $E$2:$G$10, 3), which is copied down

that column. This function takes the value of the random

number in cell I2, finds the last number in the first column   
of the table range that is less than the random number,   
and returns the value in the third column of the table range.   
In this case, 0.49 is the last number in column E that is   
less than 0.530612386, so the function returns 5% as the   
outcome. An alternative way to generate outcomes in this   
fashion is simply to embed RAND( ) within the VLOOKUP   
function, for instance,

=

VLOOKUP(RAND( ), $E$2:$G$10,

3). This is useful when we need to generate uncertain   
inputs within spreadsheet models. We will see this used in   
examples later in this chapter.

▶

Figure 12.5

Using the VLOOKUP   
Function to Sample from   
a Discrete Distribution

Any random number, then, must fall within one of

these intervals. Thus, to generate an outcome from this   
distribution, all we need to do is to select a random number   
and determine the interval into which it falls. Suppose we   
use the data in [Figure 12.2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#456) The first random number is   
0.326510048. This falls in the interval corresponding to   
the sample outcome of 6. The second random number is

0.743390121. This number falls in the interval corresponding   
to an outcome of 9. Essentially, we have developed   
a technique to roll dice on a computer. If this is done   
repeatedly, the frequency of occurrence of each outcome   
should be proportional to the size of the random number   
range (that is, the probability associated with the outcome)   
because random numbers are uniformly distributed.

[Uniform Distributions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

It is quite easy to transform a random number into a random variate from a uniform distri-  
bution between

*a*

and

*b*

. Consider the formula

*U*

=

*a*

+

(

*b*

-

*a*

)

\*

RAND( )

**(12.1)**

Note that when RAND( )

=

0,

*U*

=

*a*

, and when RAND( ) approaches 1,

*U*

approaches

*b*

. For any other value of RAND( ) between 0 and 1, (

*b*

-

*a*

)

\*

RAND( ) represents the

same proportion of the interval (

*a*

,

*b*

) as RAND( ) does of the interval (0, 1). For instance,

if RAND( )

=

0.5, then

*U*

=

*a*

(

*b*

-

)

). Thus, all real numbers between

and

can occur. Since RAND( ) is uni-

.

EXAMPLE

Modeling Uncertainty with a Uniform Random Variate

The uniform distribution is often used when little is known   
about the distribution of an uncertain variable. For example,   
in trying to assess the financial implications of outsourcing   
manufacturing, uncertainty might exist in the supplier's price   
prior to designing the manufacturing process. Suppose that   
the supplier states that the price might be as low as $42 or

as high as $50 per unit. Without any other information, a   
uniform distribution is a reasonable model. Thus, the price   
can be generated as Price

=

$42

+

($50

-

$42)

\*

RAND( ),

or $42

+

$8

\*

RAND( ). If RAND generates the

random number 0.6200, then the price would be   
$42

+

$8

\*

0.6200

=

$46.96.

If you want to generate whole numbers from a uniform distribution between

*a*

and

*b*

(called a

**discrete uniform distribution**

), use the Excel function RANDBETWEEN(

*a*

,

*b*

).

The exponential distribution w[as introduced in Chapter 5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202) Exponential random variates can   
be generated easily using the Excel formula

=

-

(1

\>

l

)\*LN(RAND( )), where 1

\>

l

=

m

is the mean of the exponential distribution, and LN is the Excel function for the natural   
logarithm.

[Normal Distributions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

Normal random variates can be generated in Excel using inverse functions. Inverse func-  
tions find the value for a distribution that has a specified cumulative probability. For normal   
distributions, Excel has two inverse functions:

■

NORM.INV(

*probability, mean, standard_deviation*

)

■

NORM.S.INV(

*probability*

)

For example, the

*z*

-value for a standard normal distribution with a cumulative probability

of 0.95 is

=

NORM.S.INV(0.95), which returns 1.645. You may recall using this function

to find

*z*

-values for confidence intervals and h[ypothesis tests in Chapters 6 and 7.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#248) To use

these functions to generate random variates, simply enter

*RAND( )*

in place of

*probability*

in the function. Thus,

■

NORM.INV(

*RAND( ), mean, standard_deviation*

) generates a random variate

from a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation

■

NORM.S.INV(

*RAND( )*

) generates a random variate from a standard normal dis-

tribution (mean

=

0 and variance

=

1).

For example, NORM.INV(

*RAND( )*

, 5, 2) will generate a random variate from a normal

distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 2. Each time the worksheet is recalculated,   
a new random number and, hence, a new random variate are generated. These functions   
may be embedded in cell formulas and will generate new values whenever the worksheet   
is recalculated. The following example shows how sampling from probability distribu-  
tions can provide insights about business decisions that would be difficult to analyze   
mathematically.

A Monte Carlo Experiment for Evaluating Capital Budgeting Projects

In finance, one way of evaluating capital budgeting projects   
is to compute a profitability index (PI), which is defined as   
the ratio of the present value of future cash flows (

PV

) to the

initial investment (

I

):

PI

=

PV

\>

I

(12.2)

Because the cash flow and initial investment that may be   
required for a particular project are often uncertain, the   
profitability index is also uncertain. If we can characterize

PV

and

I

by some probability distributions, then we would

like to know the probability distribution for

PI

. For example,

suppose that

PV

is estimated to be normally distributed

with a mean of $12 million and a standard deviation of $2.5   
million, and the initial investment is also estimated to be   
normal with a mean of $3.0 million and standard deviation   
of $0.8 million. Intuitively, we might believe that the profit-  
ability index is also normally distributed with a mean of   
$12 million

\>

$3 million

=

$4 million; however, as we shall

see, this is not the case. We can use a Monte Carlo experi-  
ment to identify the probability distribution of

PI

for these

assumptions.

[Figure 12.6](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#461)shows a simple model from the Excel

file

Profitability Index Experiment

. For each experiment,

the values of

PV

and

I

are sampled from their assumed

normal distributions using the NORM.INV function in   
columns F and G, and

PI

is calculated in column H.

The average value of

PI

for 1,000 experiments is shown

in cell D7. We clearly see that this is not equal to 4 as   
previously suspected. The histogram in[Figure 12.7](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#461) also   
demonstrates that the distribution of

PI

is not normal

but is skewed to the right. This experiment confirms   
that the ratio of two normal distributions is not normally   
distributed. We encourage you to create this spreadsheet   
and replicate this experiment (note that your results   
will not be exactly the same as these because you are   
generating random values!).

To generate a random variate from a binomial distribution, we may use the Excel function   
BINOM.INV(

). In terms of the notation we used in [Chapter 5,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)

*n*

, and

*probability*

is probability of a success

in each trial,

*p*

. To randomly generate a binomial random

variate, we simply replace

*alpha*

with RAND( ); that is, BINOM.INV(

).

Thus, over a ten-hour period, we would expect 48

a larger number of samples would average closer to 4.8.

We briefly discussed the triangular distrib[ution in Chapter 5. Recall that this distrib](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)ution

Using the Triangular Distribution for a U.S. Olympic Bid Risk Assessment

In 1990, Cincinnati was one of six cities in the United   
States that submitted a proposal to host the 2012   
Olympics. The author was involved in assisting the   
committee to conduct a risk analysis of their budget to   
predict whether the budget would be met (a condition   
required by the U.S. Olympic Committee). Because of the   
uncertainty in estimating many of the financial parameters,   
such as TV broadcast revenues, ticket sales, and so   
on, triangular distributions were used to model these

uncertainties. [Figure 12.9](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#463)shows a spreadsheet (Excel file

generate the random variate in cell B10. The spreadsheet   
also shows a table with 100 samples from the distribution.   
The histogram shows that the distribution is roughly

considerable variation in the outcomes as the spreadsheet

We may apply the methods in the previous section for generating random variates to build   
and implement Monte Carlo simulation models in Excel spreadsheets and conduct risk   
analyses. In this section, we illustrate several examples of using simulation for descriptive,   
predictive, and prescriptive analytics applications.

The general process for performing Monte Carlo simulation in Excel is as follows:

**1.**

Develop the spreadsheet model.

**2.**

Determine the probability distributions that describe the uncertain inputs in the   
model and use the appropriate Excel functions to generate random variates for   
these uncertain inputs.

**3.**

Identify the model output that you wish to evaluate.

**4.**

Determine the number of trials (replications) for the simulation.

**5.**

Create a data table to summarize the values of the model output for the replications.

**6.**

Compute summary statistics, percentiles, confidence intervals, frequency   
distributions, and histograms to interpret the results.

[In Example 12.1, we discussed the probability distributions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#455)for the uncertain inputs for the

Specifically, we have the following:

[the approach illustrated in Example 12.4, we constructed](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#459)a lookup table to generate the demand based on   
the probability distribution. Then we use the function

(G11

[Finally, we use formula (12.4) to generate triangular random](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#462)variates for the fixed cost. In cell B7, we enter the formula

G16))). This

completes step 2 of the Monte Carlo simulation process.   
If you recalculate the spreadsheet manually, you will see   
that each of these values changes randomly and leads to a   
different value for the profit, which is the model output that   
we wish to evaluate.

To perform the simulation (steps 4 and 5), we need to generate a sufficient number

of trials, or replications, to obtain enough data to create a reasonable distribution of the   
model output values. From statistics, you already know that the larger the sample size, the   
more accurate the results. Because we are doing the simulation in Excel, we are somewhat   
limited in the number of replications that we can easily compute. (Professional software   
has more powerful capabilities.) However, when dealing with relatively small models, it   
is fairly easy to generate several hundred replications using data tables. The following   
example illustrates how to do this.

Using Data Tables and Analyzing Results for Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel

We may use either one-way or two-way data tables for   
simulation. For a relatively small number of trials, say 100 or   
less, one-way tables suffice, but for a larger number of trials   
it is better to use a two-way table to consolidate the data   
in a better fashion. In this example, we will use a one-way   
table; in later examples, we will use two-way tables.

[First, construct a one-way data table (see Chapter 11)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)

by listing the number of trials down a column and   
referencing the cell associated with the profit (cell C22) in   
[the cell above and to the right of the list. In Figure 12.11,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#466)we used 100 trials, extending from cell L3 to cell L102, and   
cell M2 references cell C22. Select the range of the table   
(L2:M102)---and here's the trick---in the

Column Input Cell

field in the

Data Table

dialog, enter

any blank cell

in the

spreadsheet. Make sure that this is one you will not use.   
When you click

OK

in the

Data Table

dialog, the values in

column M will display the simulation results for the profit.

Why does this work? Recall that when you create a

data table, the

Column Input Cell

generally refers to some

parameter in the model. The data table simply takes these   
values, replaces them in the model, and then displays the   
output. Because we used a blank cell for the

Column Input

Cell

, the trial numbers do not affect the model. However,

for each trial, the spreadsheet is recalculated. Since we   
used the RAND function to generate random variates, each   
recalculation uses different values for the uncertain inputs. We   
may repeat the simulation by recalculating the spreadsheet.   
Because you may want to preserve the results for subsequent   
analysis, we suggest setting the

Calculations Options

in the

Formulas

tab to

Automatic Except for Data Tables

.

The last step in the simulation process is to analyze

the results using various statistical tools such as summary

statistics, percentiles, confidence intervals, and frequency   
distributions and histograms. We don't recommend using

Data Analysis

tools because if you wish to recalculate the

spreadsheet and run a new simulation, the results will not   
update. Instead, use Excel functions.

[Figure 12.12 shows statistical analyses of the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#466)

simulation results. A point estimate for the mean profit is   
$228,038.77. Because the simulation was based on only   
100 trials, sampling error may be significant. We can assess   
this by developing a confidence interval. Using formula   
(6.3), a 95% confidence interval for the mean is

$228,038.77

{

1.96($53,828.55

\>

10),

or

\[$217,488.37, 238,589.17\]

A larger number of trials would decrease the width of this   
interval.

The standard deviation of profit is quite large, and

you can also see that the simulated values range from   
about $117,000 to $337,000, indicating that considerable   
variability exists in the predicted profit. The frequency   
distribution and histogram likewise provide a perspective of   
this variability. To find the frequency distribution, we used   
COUNTIF functions to find the cumulative frequencies,   
and then found the number of observations in each cell by   
subtraction. The percentiles allow you to make probability   
statements about the profit and analyze risk. For instance,   
we see that the 90th percentile is $290,592. This means   
that there is only a 10% chance that the profit will exceed   
this value. Percentiles allow you to analyze risk. For   
instance, if the company needs to make a profit of at least   
$280,000, we see that the probability of that happening is   
only about 0.15.

An easier alternative to compute a frequency distribution is to use the Excel function

FREQUENCY(

*data array, bin array*

). This is an "array" function and returns values in a range

of cells. When you enter an array formula, you must first select the range in which to place   
the results. Then, after entering the formula, you must press Ctrl+Shift+Enter in Windows or   
Command+Shift+Enter on a Mac simultaneously. For example, in [Figure 12.12,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#466) instead of com-  
puting the cumulative frequencies and frequencies in columns S and T, we could have selected   
the range S4:S17, then entered

=

FREQUENCY(M3:M102, R4:R17), and pressed Ctrl (or

Command) +Shift+Enter. The range would be filled with the frequencies. In this fashion, we   
avoid having to compute cumulative frequencies and then convert them into frequencies.

The

*Moore Pharmaceuticals*

spreadsheet model to support a new-product development

decision was introduced in [Chapter 11](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)(see [Figure 11.14](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#425)). Although the values used in the   
spreadsheet suggest that the new drug would become profitable by the fourth year, much   
of the data in this model are uncertain. Thus, we might be interested in evaluating the   
risk associated with the project. Three questions we might be interested in are as follows:

**1.**

What is the risk that the net present value over the five years will not be positive?

**2.**

What are the chances that the product will show a positive cumulative net profit   
in the third year?

**3.**

In the fifth year, what minimum amount of cumulative profit are we likely to   
achieve with a probability of at least 0.90?

Suppose that the project manager of Moore Pharmaceuticals has identified the fol-

lowing uncertain variables in the model and the distributions and parameters that describe   
them, as follows:

■

Market size: normal with mean of 2,000,000 units and standard deviation of   
400,000 units

■

R\&D costs: uniform between $600,000,000 and $800,000,000

■

Clinical trial costs: normal with mean of $150,000,000 and standard deviation   
$30,000,000

■

Annual market growth factor: triangular with minimum

=

2%, maximum

=

6%,

and most likely

=

3%

■

Annual market share growth rate: triangular with   
minimum

=

15%, maximum

=

25%, and most likely

=

20%

The next example shows how to implement a Monte Carlo simulation for this scenario.

Moore

Pharmaceuticals

model for Monte Carlo simulation (Excel file

Moore Pharmaceuticals Excel Simulation Model

). In the profit

model example ([Example 12.9](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#464)), we saw how to incorporate   
uniform and triangular random variates into a simulation   
model. In this example, we also have uncertain inputs that are   
normally distributed. We may use the NORM.INVfunction to   
generate these random variates. Thus, the formula in cell B5   
is

=

NORM.INV(RAND( ), I4, J4), and the formula in cell B12

is

=

NORM.INV(RAND( ), I12, J12).

In this problem, note that we must use different values

for the annual market growth factor and annual market   
share growth rate in each year of the model, as these   
values are independent of each other. This means that   
we have to use a different random number for each of the   
triangular distributions. Thus, we have created a separate   
distribution for each year in columns J through M.

Based on the risk analysis questions that we wish

to answer, we define the cumulative net profit in the third   
year (cell D28), the cumulative net profit in the fifth year   
(cell F28), and the net present value (cell B30) as the model   
outputs of interest.

Because we have three different model outputs, we

need to create three data tables, one for each output to   
conduct the simulation. In general, you should use a larger   
number of trials for models that have a larger number of   
uncertain inputs. In this example, we will use 500 trials. To   
do this more efficiently, we can use two-way data tables.   
[Figure 12.14 shows a portion of one of these data tables,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#468)which uses five columns of 100 trials (a total of 500 trials).   
See the Excel file for the complete results. In the

Row Input Cell

and

Column Input Cell

(being sure not to use the same cells for

different data tables).

As with the profit model example, we can compute summary statistics, percentiles,

and frequency distributions to analyze the results. Then we may address the risk analy-  
sis questions posed earlier using percentile information (see [Chapter 4)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144) as the following

1.

What is the probability that the net present value over

the five years will not be positive?

We can answer this

question using percentiles. Be careful when using   
Excel tools. For example, the

Rank \& Percentile

tool

requires the data to be in one column; therefore,   
you cannot use this tool with a two-way data table.   
However, we can easily construct a simple table of   
percentiles using the PERCENTILE.INC(

array

,

k

) func-

tion, as shown in[Figure 12.15.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#469) The

array

is the data

table range, and

k

is the percentile value between 0

and 1, which is referenced in column AJ. We see that   
the probability that the net present value will not be

positive is somewhere between 0.15 and 0.20. More   
refinement can find this more accurately.

2.

What are the chances that the product will show a posi-

tive cumulative net profit in the third year?

Again, using

percentiles for the third-year value, you should try to   
verify that the probability of a positive cumulative net   
profit in the third year is less than 10%.

3.

In the fifth year, what minimum amount of cumulative

profit are we likely to achieve with a probability of at

least 0.90?

Here, we are looking for the 10th percentile,

which, depending on the variation in the simulation   
results, is about $160 million.

In [Chapter 11,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)we developed a model for predicting the amount that an individual might   
have saved upon retirement. This model, however, was based on some unrealistic assump-  
tions, namely, that the annual salary increase and expected annual investment returns are   
constant for each year. In reality, these values will typically change each year. More impor-  
tantly, investment returns may not necessarily have a positive return each year. Thus, using   
these assumptions can easily overestimate the predicted retirement savings and not pro-  
vide any information about risk and variability. The following example shows how we can   
enrich this model to make it more realistic through Monte Carlo simulation.

EXAMPLE

12.13

Retirement Planning Model

Monte Carlo Simulation

To build more realism into the model, let us assume that the   
annual salary increase may vary from 2% to 5%, uniformly   
distributed. Data on the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund   
show that the average recent return is about 6%, but that it   
also has a standard deviation of 6.5%. For the Boston Trust   
Asset Management Fund, the average return is about 6.5%   
with a standard deviation of 7%.

To build these assumptions into the model, we need

to create new columns to generate random values for the   
annual salary increase and investment returns and make   
some adjustments in other formulas. [Figure 12.16](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#470) shows   
the enhanced model (Excel file

column generate uniform random variates using the Excel   
formula

The formulas for the returns

and standard deviations. We assume that these annual

changes apply to the previous year's salary and fund   
balances.

Now we can use a data table to simulate the final

retirement balance. We used a two-way table with 100 rows   
and 10 columns to simulate 1,000 trials. A portion of the   
[data table is shown in Figure 12.17. Figure 12.18 on page](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#471)442 shows the statistical analysis. We see that although the   
average is around $3.6 million, the standard deviation and   
range are quite large. The histogram is positively skewed,   
indicating that very high returns are rather unlikely.

We may also calculate probabilities to address

questions of risk. For example, the probability that the   
retirement balance will be $3 million or less is estimated   
to be 235

0.235. The probability that it will be

provide reasonable assurance of a comfortable retirement.

In [Chapter 11,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406) we introduced a model for single-period purchase decisions: the news-  
vendor problem. In this model, we calculated the net profit associated with purchasing a   
quantity

*Q*

in advance of a selling season and realizing a demand

*D*

in the future. In reality,

demand will not be known and can be modeled by some probability distribution. The deci-  
sion problem that a seller faces is determining the best purchase quantity to maximize the   
expected net profit. We may use Monte Carlo simulation to find the distribution of the net   
profit for any purchase quantity, and then use the model to find the best purchase quantity.   
In this fashion, we are using Monte Carlo simulation as a prescriptive approach.

The following example shows how to use Monte Carlo simulation by resampling from

historical data.

VLOOKUP(RAND( ), K3:M14, 3) in cell B11. Now we

may easily simulate the profit using a data table.

However, the objective is to find the purchase quantity

that maximizes the expected profit. To do this, we can   
use a two-way data table where the rows represent the   
simulation trials and the columns correspond to the   
purchase quantity. Thus, in the

Data Table

dialog, set the

Row Input Cell

as B12 and the

purchase quantity. We computed the average and standard   
deviation of profit above the table. We can observe   
two things. First, the largest average profit occurs for a   
purchase quantity of 45 (although this may vary in different   
simulations). Second, the range and standard deviation   
generally increase as the purchase quantity increases,   
suggesting a higher amount of risk. For example, we see   
that 29 of the 200 profit values for

Q

=

45 fall at or below

$240, resulting in a lower profit than if the seller orders 40   
boxes. However, the remainder are larger than $240. Thus,   
a high probability exists of making a higher profit. Similarly,   
if 51 boxes are ordered, the profit may be as low as $207,   
but as high as $306---a higher profit potential, but also a   
higher risk.

We may use these data to construct an empirical

probability distribution and use this to simulate the   
[demand. Figure 12.19 (Excel file](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#472)

This example showed how we can use simulation for prescriptive decisions, as well as

assess the risk of alternative decisions. We should note that while sampling from empiri-  
cal data is easy to do, it does have some drawbacks. First, the empirical data may not   
adequately represent the true underlying population because of sampling error. Second,   
using an empirical distribution precludes sampling values outside the range of the actual

data. Therefore, it is usually advisable to fit a distribution and use it for the uncertain vari-  
able. We can do this by fitting a distribution to the data using the techniques we described   
[in Chapter 5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)

We also introduced overbooking decisions in[Chapter 11](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406). In any realistic situation,   
the actual customer demand as well as the number of cancellations would be uncer-  
tain. Similar to the newsvendor problem, we may use Monte Carlo simulation to help   
determine the best overbooking policy. We illustrate this in the following, based on   
[Example 11.9.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#421)

distributed with a mean of 320 and standard deviation of 15.   
Because we want this value to be a whole number, we can use   
the Excel function ROUND (

number, num_digits

); thus using

=

ROUND(NORM.INV(RAND( ), 320, 15), 0)

in cell B14 will guarantee this. The number of cancella-  
tions depends on the number of reservations made in   
cell B15. Suppose that the probability that any reservation   
is cancelled is 0.04. Then the number of cancellations is   
a binomial random variable, with

n

=

number of reser-

vations made, and

p

=

0.04. We may enter the formula

=

BINOM.INV(B15, 0.04, RAND( )) into cell B16 to generate

a binomial random variate. Note that we are referencing cell

B15 in this formula as it will change in each simulated trial   
because of the random demand.

The decision variable is the reservation limit in cell

B13. We may use data tables to simulate the number of   
overbooked customers and net revenue for each choice of the   
reservation limit. We use two-way data tables with 100 rows   
(trials) and 7 columns corresponding to reservation limit   
decisions, from 300 to 330 in increments of 5. In [Figure 12.21,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#473)we see that as the reservation limit (shown in the range   
E4:K4) increases, so does the average number of overbooked   
customers. We also see that the average net revenue   
is maximized when 315 reservations are taken; that is,   
overbooking the hotel by 15 rooms. For 315 reservations, we   
also see that the average number of overbooked customers is   
1.74 (cell H3).

they have a triangular distribution. Analytical methods, such as the Program Evaluation   
and Review Technique (PERT), allow us to determine probabilities of project completion   
times by assuming that the project completion time is normally distributed. However, this   
assumption may not always be valid. Simulation can provide a more realistic characteriza-

A Spreadsheet Simulation Model for Project Management

Suppose that the information systems manager has   
determined the most likely time for each activity but,   
recognizing the uncertainty in the times to complete each   
task, has estimated the smallest and largest times that   
[the activities might take. These are shown in Table 12.1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#474)With only these estimates, a triangular distribution is an   
appropriate assumption. Note that the times for activities A,   
G, M, P, and Q are constant.

[Figure 12.22](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#475)shows a spreadsheet model designed

to simulate the project completion time when the activity   
times are uncertain (Excel file

Becker Consulting Project

Management Simulation Model

). The mean activity times

using the triangular distributions are calculated in column E.   
If we use these to find the critical path, we would find that   
the project completion time is 155, with activities B, F, G,   
H, I, K, M, O, P, and Q on the critical path. Calculations for   
the triangular random variates are shown in columns N and   
O. The values of the random variates are referenced in the   
shaded cells in column F. For this simulation, we see that the   
completion time is 148.67. Note that as the activity times vary   
randomly, different project completion times and critical paths   
may result (manually recalculate the spreadsheet several times   
to see this). We may use a data table to simulate the project   
completion time.[Figure 12.23](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#475)shows the simulation results.

estate lending, undertakes some of the world's largest

real estate transactions. Hypo was faced with the chal-

lenge of complying with Basel II banking regulations in

Europe. Basel II sets the minimum capital to be held in

reserve by internationally active banks. If a bank is able to

comply with the more demanding requirements of the reg-

ulations, it can potentially save €20--€60 million per year in

capital costs. To qualify however, Hypo needed new risk

models and reporting systems. The company also wished

to upgrade its internal reporting and management frame-

work to provide better analytical tools to its lending offi-

cers, who were responsible for structuring new loans, and

to provide its managers with better insights into the risks

of the overall portfolio.

Monte Carlo simulation is the only practical

approach for analyzing the risk models the bank needed.

For example, in one commercial real estate application,

200 different macroeconomic and market variables are

typically simulated over 20 years. The cash-flow model-

ing process can be even more complex, particularly if the

effects of all the intricate details of the transaction must

be quantified. However, the computational process of

Monte Carlo simulation is numerically intensive because

the entire spreadsheet must be recalculated both for each

iteration of the simulation and for each individual asset (or

transaction) within the portfolio. This pushes the limits of

stand-alone Excel models, even for a single asset. More-

over, because the bank is usually interested in analyzing

its entire portfolio of thousands of assets, in practice, it

becomes impossible to do so using stand-alone Excel.

Therefore, Hypo needed a way to implement the

complex analytics of simulation in a way that its global

offices could use on all their thousands of loans. In addi-

tion to the computational intensity of simulation analyt-

ics, the option to build the entire simulation framework in

Excel can lead to human error, which they called

spread-

sheet risk

. Spreadsheet risks that Hypo wished to mini-

mize included the following:

■

■

Proliferation of spreadsheet models that are stored

on individual users' desktop computers throughout

the organization and are untested and lack version

data, and the unsanctioned manipulation of the results of

spreadsheet calculations.

■

■

Potential for serious mistakes resulting from typographical

and "cut and copy-and-paste" errors when entering data

from other applications or spreadsheets.

■

■

Accidental acceptance of results from incomplete

calculations.

■

■

Errors associated with running an insufficient num-

ber of Monte Carlo iterations because of data or time

constraints.

Given these potential problems, Hypo deemed a pure

Excel solution as impractical. Instead, they used a consulting

firm's proprietary software, called the Specialized Finance Sys-

tem (SFS), which embeds spreadsheets within a high-perfor-

mance, server-based system for enterprise applications. This

eliminated the spreadsheet risks but allowed users to exploit

the flexible programming power that spreadsheets provide,

while giving confidence and trust in the results. The new sys-

tem has improved management reporting and the efficiency of

internal processes and has also provided insights into structur-

ing new loans to make them less risky and more profitable.

technician. In these systems, customers arrive at random times, and service times are rarely   
predictable. Managers of these systems would be interested in knowing how long custom-  
ers have to wait, the length of waiting lines, the utilization of the servers, and other mea-  
sures of performance. Another example of a dynamic system is an inventory management   
system. Managers would be interested in knowing inventory levels, numbers of lost sales   
or backorders incurred, and the costs of operating the system. More complex examples of   
dynamic systems include entire production systems, which might incorporate aspects of   
both waiting lines and inventory systems, as well as material movement, information flow,   
and so on.

Dynamic system simulation models allow us to draw conclusions about the behavior

of a real system by studying the behavior of a model of the system, usually with random   
sequences of events similar to what we might observe in the real system. Simulation has   
the advantage of being able to incorporate nearly any practical assumption and thus is   
the most flexible tool for dealing with dynamic systems. In practice, simulating dynamic   
systems is best accomplished using powerful commercial software; however, we can use   
Excel quite easily for some simple applications to illustrate the concepts.

Modeling dynamic systems is generally more difficult than just replicating spread-

sheets using Monte Carlo simulation, primarily because the logical sequence of events   
over time must be explicitly taken into account. For instance, key events that occur in a   
waiting line system are arrivals of customers, completions of services, and possibly line-  
switching or a customer's decision to leave a line because of excessive waiting. Events in   
an inventory system include the demand for items, receipt of replenishment orders, and   
placement of new orders. The next example illustrates a dynamic simulation for a simple   
production and inventory scenario and also shows how we can incorporate Monte Carlo   
simulation into the analysis.

EXAMPLE

12.17

A Production/Inventory Simulation

Mantel Manufacturing supplies various engine components   
to manufacturers of motorcycles on a just-in-time basis.   
Planned production capacity for one component is 100   
units per shift, and the plant operates one shift per day.   
Because of fluctuations in customers' assembly operations,   
however, demand fluctuates and is historically between 80   
and 130 units per day. To maintain sufficient inventory to   
meet its just-in-time commitments, the operations manager   
is considering a policy to run a second shift the next day if   
inventory falls to 50 or below at the end of a day (after the   
daily demand is known). For the annual budget planning   
process, he needs to know how many additional shifts will   
be needed.

The fundamental equation that governs this process

each day is

Mantel Manufacturing

) to simulate 260 working days

(one year) and count the number of additional shifts that

are required. We assume that on day 1, the initial inven-  
tory and production are 100 units. The Excel function   
RANDBETWEEN(80, 130) is used in column C to gener-  
ate discrete uniform random variates for the demand. In   
column D, we use an IF function to determine whether   
an additional production shift is scheduled based on the   
beginning inventory in column B. For example, the formula   
in cell D6 is

=

IF(B6

ending inventory is calculated using [equation (12.5);](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#477) this is   
copied to the beginning inventory for the next day.

The chart shows the ending inventory and production

each day. The spikes in the production series show when   
additional shifts were scheduled. If you recalculate the   
spreadsheet, the results will change. Since the model   
provides results only for one year, we use a data table with   
100 trials to replicate the spreadsheet in order to determine   
[a distribution for the number of additional shifts (see Figure
12.25). While the average is close to 13, considerable](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#478)variation exists among simulation runs. To be safe, the   
budget should plan on a higher number of shifts than the   
average.

We will develop a simulation model for a waiting line (queueing) system. We assume that   
there is a single server. Customers arrive at the system and join a waiting line on a first-  
come, first-served basis if the server is busy; otherwise, they go immediately into service.   
Then they receive the service and leave the system. Typical performance measures that   
we would like to evaluate are the average waiting time per customer, the idle time of the   
server, and the number in the queue.

To understand the logic behind the simulation model, consider the sequence of activi-

ties that each customer undergoes:

**1.**

Customer arrives.

**2.**

Customer waits for service if the server is busy.

Chapter 12

Simulation and Risk Analysis

**3.**

Customer receives service.

**4.**

Customer leaves the system.

We can make the following observations:

**1.**

If a customer arrives at time

*t*

and the server is not busy, then that customer can

begin service immediately upon arrival.

**2.**

If a customer arrives at time

*t*

and the server is busy, then that customer will

begin service at the time that the

*previous*

customer completes service (which

will be greater than

*t*

). The waiting time is the difference between the time ser-

vice begins and the arrival time.

**3.**

In either case, the time at which a customer completes service is computed as the   
time that the customer begins service plus the time it takes to perform the service.

**4.**

The server idle time is the difference between the arrival time of the next cus-  
tomer and the time at which the current customer completes service, if the   
arrival time of the next customer is greater than the time at which the current   
customer completes service; otherwise, the idle time is zero.

**5.**

To find the number in the queue, we note that when a customer arrives, then all   
prior customers who have not completed service by that time must still be waiting.

These observations provide all the information we need to run a small manual simulation.

[Table 12.2 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#479)ws such a simulation. We assume that the system opens at time 0 and

that the arrival times and service times have been generated by some random mecha-  
nism and are known. We can use the logic above to complete the last five columns. For   
example, the first customer arrives at time 3.2 (the server is idle from time 0 until this   
event). Because the queue is empty, customer 1 immediately begins service and ends at   
time 3.2

=

6.9. The server is idle until the next customer arrives at time 10.5. Cus-

tomer 2 then begins service and completes service at time 10.5

3.5

=

14.0. Customer 3

arrives at time 12.8. Because customer 2 is still in service, customer 3 must wait until time   
14.0 to begin service, incurring a waiting time of 1.2. You should verify the calculations for   
the remaining customers in this simulation.

[Figure 12.26](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#480)shows the formulas for a spreadsheet model that corresponds to[Table 12.2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#479)

The start time for any customer is the maximum of the arrival time and the time of service of   
the previous customer. This is implemented using the MAX function. Waiting time is simply   
the difference between the start time and arrival time; idle time for the server is computed   
from the arrival time of the current customer and the completion time of the last customer.   
Finding the length of the queue when a customer arrives is a bit tricky. For example, in   
[Table 12.2,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#479)customer 5 arrives at time 17.2. At this time, customer 3 is still in service and

customer 4 is waiting until time 18.3. Thus, the length of the queue is now 2. We can com-  
pute this using a MATCH function to determine the last customer whose completion time is   
less than or equal to the arrival time of the current customer. For example, the value of the   
MATCH function in cell D7 is 3; therefore, 5

2 provides the correct value for the

number in the queue. To make this work correctly if customer 2 arrives before customer 1   
has completed service, we needed to add an end time of 0 in cell F2 for "customer zero" and   
include this in the MATCH range.

Car Wash Simulation

Mike and Judy operate a small car wash; Judy is in charge   
of finance, accounting, and marketing and Mike is in   
charge of operations. On a typical Saturday, customers   
arrive randomly between three and eight minutes apart.   
A standard wash takes four minutes (the service time),   
but may run as high as seven minutes for those cars that   
purchase extra services. The probabilities of the times   
between arrivals and service times are estimated from   
historical data. Although customers may complain a bit,   
they do not leave if they have to wait.

To simulate this system on a spreadsheet, we need

to generate the arrival times of customers and the time   
required for service. For arrivals, we could specify either the   
actual

times

that customers arrive for service or the

times

between successive arrivals

. The second approach works

better for simulation purposes because we need only know

the time that the last customer arrived to generate the arrival   
time of the next customer. Therefore, we set the arrival time   
for a customer as the arrival time of the previous customer   
plus a random value. We use discrete distributions in   
column J--M for the time between arrivals and service time,   
and we use VLOOKUP functions to find these.

[Figure 12.27 shows the spreadsheet model (Excel file](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#480)

). The model simulates 100 customers

(roughly one day). We calculate the maximum number in   
the queue, maximum waiting time, average waiting time   
per customer, and total idle time. It does not make sense   
to average the number in the queue or idle time, because   
these are time-dependent, not customer-dependent.   
Because this model only simulates one day, you could use   
data tables to find distributions for these measures. We   
leave this as an exercise.

diseases and pests, while providing higher yields than the   
varieties currently available. A project lead makes decisions   
that improve the parent varieties with a process called trait   
introgression (TI).

Key to the new strategy is the combination of advanced

analytics and plant-breeding knowledge to find opportunities   
to increase crop productivity and optimize plant-breeding   
processes. Syngenta uses systems and Monte Carlo simula-  
tion models to codify Syngenta Soybean R\&D best practices   
and help create the best soybean-breeding plans and stra-  
tegically align its research efforts. The TI tool uses systems   
simulation to model the flow of a process, the biology of cre-  
ating progeny from mating two plants, and the calculations   
needed to track genetic segregation according to Mendel's   
principles of genetics. Although cost and time are key out-  
comes of the TI tool, knowing both the expected number of   
seeds with the desired combination of traits and the uncer-  
tainty surrounding that expectation is critical to selecting the   
best breeding plan. Simulation allows a project lead to plan   
each process step and view the consequences of the plan on   
cumulative cost, cumulative time, and genetic composition   
of the progeny at the end of each step in the TI process. If   
the cost, time, or probability of successfully transferring the   
desired traits of the planned TI process is unacceptable, the   
project lead can change one or more decisions and quickly   
rerun the simulation.

Develop a simulation model for a three-year finan-  
cial analysis of total profit based on the following   
data and information. Sales volume in the first year   
is estimated to be 100,000 units and is projected   
to grow at a rate that is normally distributed with   
a mean of 7% per year and a standard deviation of   
4%. The selling price is $10, and the price increase is   
normally distributed with a mean of $0.50 and stan-  
dard deviation of $0.05 each year. Per-unit variable   
costs are $3, and annual fixed costs are $200,000.   
Per-unit costs are expected to increase by an amount   
normally distributed with a mean of 5% per year and   
standard deviation of 2%. Fixed costs are expected   
to increase following a normal distribution with a   
mean of 10% per year and standard deviation of 3%.   
Based on 500 simulation trials, compute summary   
statistics for the average three-year undiscounted

Tanner Park (see Problem 24 in [Chapter 11)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406) is a   
small amusement park that provides a variety of   
rides and outdoor activities for children and teens. In   
a typical summer season, the number of adult tickets   
sold has a normal distribution with a mean of 20,000   
and a standard deviation of 2,000. The number of   
children's tickets sold has a normal distribution with   
a mean of 10,000 and a standard deviation of 1,000.   
Adult ticket prices are $18 and the children's price is   
$10. Revenue from food and beverage concessions   
is estimated to be between $50,000 and $100,000,   
with a most likely value of $60,000. Likewise, sou-  
venir revenue has a minimum of $20,000, most   
likely value of $25,000, and a maximum value of   
$30,000. Variable costs per person are $3, and fixed   
costs amount to $150,000. Determine the distribu-  
tion of profit for this business using 500 trials. What   
is the probability that the park will make a profit of   
$250,000 or less?

graduate without much business experience and   
has engaged the services of one of her friends who   
recently obtained an MBA to assist her with financial   
analysis of the business and evaluation of the prof-  
itability of introducing a new product. The shop is   
open during the spring and summer, with higher sales   
in the summer season. Based on past observation,   
Lily has defined three sales scenarios for the new   
product.

Summer:

■

High---3,000 units

■

Most likely---2,500 units

■

Low---2,100 units

Spring:

■

High---2,500 units

■

Most likely---1,500 units

■

Low---1,000 units

The expected price is $3.00. However, the unit cost is   
uncertain, and driven by the costs of the ingredients   
she has to buy for the product. This is estimated to   
be between $1.40 and $2.00, with a most likely value   
of $1.50 in the summer, but in the spring, the most   
likely cost is $2.00 because the ingredients are more   
difficult to obtain then. Fixed costs are estimated to   
be $2,600. Find the distribution of profit for each sea-  
son and the annual profit distribution using 200 trials   
for each.

The Kelly Theater produces plays and musicals for   
a regional audience. For a typical performance, the   
theater sells at least 250 tickets and occasionally   
reaches its capacity of 600 seats. Most often, about   
450 tickets are sold. The fixed cost for each perfor-  
mance is normal with a mean of $2,500 and a stan-  
dard deviation of $250. Ticket prices range from $30   
to $70 depending on the location of the seat. Of the   
600 seats, 150 are priced at $70, 200 at $55, and the   
remaining at $30. Of all the tickets sold, the $55 seats   
sell out first. If the total demand is at least 500, then   
all the $70 seats sell out. If not, then between 50%   
and 75% of the $70 seats sell, with the remainder   
being the $30 seats. If, however, the total demand is   
less than or equal to 350, then the number of $70 and   
$30 seats sold are usually split evenly. The theater   
runs 160 performances per year and incurs an annual   
fixed cost of $2 million. Develop a simulation model   
to evaluate the profitability of the theater using 250   
trials. What is the distribution of annual net profit and   
the risk of losing money over a year?

J\&G Bank receives a large number of credit card   
applications each month, an average of 30,000 with   
a standard deviation of 4,000, normally distrib-  
uted. Approximately 60% of them are approved,   
but this typically varies between 50% and 70%.   
Each customer charges a total of $2,000, normally   
distributed, with a standard deviation of $250, to   
his or her credit card each month. Approximately   
85% pay off their balances in full, and the remain-  
ing incur finance charges. The average finance   
charge has recently ranged from 3% to 4% per   
month. The bank also receives income from fees   
charged for late payments and annual fees associ-  
ated with the credit cards. This is a percentage of   
total monthly charges and has varied between 6.8%   
and 7.2%. It costs the bank $20 per application,   
whether it is approved or not. The monthly main-  
tenance cost for credit card customers is normally   
distributed with a mean of $10 and standard devia-  
tion of $1.50. Finally, losses due to charge-offs of   
customers' accounts are between 4.6% and 5.4% of   
total charges. Use Monte Carlo simulation with 500   
trials to analyze the profitability of the credit card   
product.

Sturgill Manufacturing Inc. needs to predict the   
numbers of machines and employees required to   
produce its planned production for the coming year.   
The plant runs three shifts continuously during the   
workweek, for a total of 120 hours of capacity per   
week. The shop efficiency (the percent of total time   
available for production), which accounts for setups,   
changeovers, and maintenance, averages 70% with a   
standard deviation of 5%, which reduces the weekly   
capacity. Six key parts are produced, and the plant   
has three different types of machines to produce each   
part. The machines are not interchangeable as they   
each have a specific function. The time to produce   
each part on each machine varies. The mean time and   
standard deviation (in hours) to produce each part on   
each machine are shown below:

The operations manager has to determine the quan-  
tity to produce in the face of uncertain demand. One   
option is to simply produce the mean demand for each   
product; depending on the actual demand, this could   
result in a shortage (lost sales). The other option is to   
produce at a level equal to the 75th percentile of the   
demand distribution for each product (that is, find the   
value so that 75% of the area under the normal distri-  
bution is to the left). Using Monte Carlo simulation   
with 150 trials, evaluate and compare summary statis-  
tics for these policies and write a report for the opera-  
tions manager summarizing your findings. Make sure   
to round normal variates to whole numbers. What   
trade-offs does the manager have to make?

The Executive Committee of Reder Electric Vehi-

whether to replace its original model, the REV-Tour-  
ing, with a new model, the REV-Sport, which would   
appeal to a younger audience. Whatever vehicle is   
chosen, it will be produced for the next four years,   
after which time a reevaluation will be necessary. The   
REV-Sport has passed through the concept and initial   
design phases and is ready for final design and manu-  
facturing. Final development costs are estimated to be   
$75 million, and the new fixed costs for tooling and   
manufacturing are estimated to be $600 million. The   
REV-Sport is expected to sell for $30,000. The first-  
year sales for the REV-Sport is estimated to be nor-  
mally distributed with an average of 60,000/year and   
standard deviation of 12,000/year. The sales growth

for subsequent years is estimated to be normally dis-  
tributed with an average of 6% and standard deviation   
of 2%. The variable cost per vehicle is uncertain until   
the design and supply-chain decisions are finalized,   
but is estimated to be between $20,000 and $28,000   
with the most likely value being $22,000. Next-year   
sales for the REV-Touring are estimated to be 50,000   
with a standard deviation of 9,000/year, but the sales   
are expected to decrease at a rate that is normally dis-  
tributed with a mean of 10% and standard deviation   
of 3.5% for each of the next three years. The sell-  
ing price is $28,000. Variable costs are constant at   
$21,000. Since the model has been in production, the   
fixed costs for development have already been recov-  
ered. Develop a four-year Monte Carlo simulation   
model using 500 trials to recommend the best deci-  
sion using a net present value discount rate of 4%.

The Schoch Museum (see [Problem 30 in Chapter 11)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)is embarking on a five-year fundraising campaign. As   
a nonprofit institution, the museum finds it challeng-  
ing to acquire new donors, as many donors do not   
contribute every year. Suppose that the museum has   
identified a pool of 8,000 potential donors. The actual   
number of donors in the first year of the campaign is   
estimated to be somewhere between 60% and 75%   
of this pool. For each subsequent year, the museum   
expects that a certain percentage of current donors   
will discontinue their contributions. This is expected   
to be between 10% and 60%, with a most likely value   
of 35%. In addition, the museum expects to attract   
some percentage of new donors. This is assumed to   
be between 5% and 40% of the current year's donors,   
with a most likely value of 10%. The average con-  
tribution in the first year is assumed to be $50 and   
will increase at a rate between 0% and 8% each sub-  
sequent year, with the most likely increase of 2.5%.   
Develop and analyze a simulation model to predict   
the total funds that will be raised over the five-year   
period using 500 trials.

ing assumptions are made. The number of patients   
served the first year is uniform between 1,300 and   
1,700; the growth rate for subsequent years is trian-  
gular with parameters (5%, 8%, 9%), and the growth   
rate for year 2 is independent of the growth rate

annual increase in fixed costs is uniform between   
5% and 7% and independent of other years. Find the

Adam is 24 years old and has a 401(k) plan through   
his employer, a large financial institution. His com-  
pany matches 50% of his contributions up to 6% of   
his salary. He currently contributes the maximum   
amount he can. In his 401(k), he has three funds.   
Investment A is a large-cap index fund, which has had   
an average annual growth over the past ten years of   
6.63% with a standard deviation of 13.46%. Invest-  
ment B is a mid-cap index fund with a ten-year aver-  
age annual growth of 9.89% and a standard deviation   
of 15.28%. Finally, Investment C is a small-cap index   
fund with a ten-year average annual growth rate of   
8.55% and a standard deviation of 16.90%. Fifty per-  
cent of his contribution is directed to Investment A,   
25% to Investment B, and 25% to Investment C. His   
current salary is $48,000 and based on a compensa-  
tion survey of financial institutions, he expects an   
average raise of 2.7% with a standard deviation of   
0.4% each year. Develop a simulation model to pre-

employed, use as much information as you can gather   
for your model, including potential salary increases,   
promotions, contributions, and rates of return based   
on the actual funds in which you invest. If you are not   
employed, try to find information about salaries in   
the industry in which you plan to work and the retire-  
ment benefits that companies in that industry offer   
for your model. Estimate rates of returns based on   
popular mutual funds used for retirement or average   
performance of stock market indexes. Clearly state   
your assumptions and how you arrived at them and

Waring Solar Systems provides solar panels and   
other energy-efficient technologies for buildings. In   
response to a customer inquiry, the company is con-  
ducting a feasibility study to determine if solar pan-  
els will provide enough energy to pay for themselves   
within the payback period. Capacity is measured in   
MWh/year (1,000 kWh). This figure is determined by   
the number of panels installed and the amount of sun-  
light the panels receive each year. Capacity can vary   
greatly due to weather conditions, especially clouds   
and snow. Engineers have determined that this client

should use an 80 MWh/year system. The cost of the   
system and installation is $80,000. The amount of   
power the system will produce is normally distributed   
with a standard deviation of 10 MWh/year. The solar   
panels become less efficient over time mostly due to   
clouding of their protective cases. The annual loss in   
efficiency is normally distributed with a mean of 1%   
and a standard deviation of 0.2% and will apply after   
the first year. The client currently obtains electricity   
from its provider at a rate of $0.109/kWh. Based on   
analysis of previous years' electric bills, the annual   
cost of electricity is expected to increase following a   
triangular distribution with most likely value of 3%,   
min of 2.5%, and max of 4%, beginning with the first   
year. The cost of capital is estimated to be 5%. Develop   
a simulation model using 500 trials to find the net   
present value of the technology over a ten-year period,   
including the system and installation cost. What is the   
probability that the system will be economical?

SPD Tax Service is a regional tax preparation firm   
that competes with such national chains as H\&R   
Block. The company is considering expanding and   
needs a financial model to analyze the decision to   
open a new store. Key factors affecting this decision   
include the demographics of the proposed location,   
price points that can be achieved in the target market,   
and the availability of funds for marketing and adver-  
tising. Capital expenditures will be ignored because   
unused equipment from other locations can often   
be shifted to a new store for the first year until they   
can be replaced periodically through the fixed cost   
budget. SPD's target markets are communities with   
populations between 30,000 and 50,000, assumed   
to be uniformly distributed. Market demand for tax   
preparation service is directly related to the number   
of households in the territory; approximately 15% of   
households are anticipated to use a tax preparation   
service. Assuming an average of 2.5 people per house-  
hold, this can be expressed as 0.15\*population

SPD estimates that its first-year demand will have   
a mean of 5% of the total market demand, and for   
every dollar of advertising, the mean increases by 2%.   
The first-year demand is assumed to be normal with   
a standard deviation of 20% of the mean demand. An   
advertising budget of $5,000 has been approved but   
is limited to 10% of annual revenues. Demand grows   
fairly aggressively in the second and third year and is   
assumed to have a triangular distribution with a mini-  
mum value of 20%, most likely value of 35%, and   
maximum value of 40%. After year 3, demand growth   
is between 5% and 15%, with a most likely value of

7%. The average charge for each tax return is $175   
and increases each year at a rate that is normally dis-  
tributed with a mean of 4% and a standard deviation   
of 1.0%. Variable costs average $15 per customer and   
increase annually at a rate that is normally distrib-  
uted with a mean of 3% and a standard deviation of   
1.5%. Fixed costs are estimated to be approximately   
$35,000 for the first year and grow annually at a rate   
between 1.5% and 3%. Develop a Monte Carlo simu-  
lation model to find the distribution of the net present   
value of the profitability over a five-year period using   
a discount rate of 3%. Use 500 trials.

that the demand is uniform with a minimum of 35,000   
and maximum of 60,000; fixed costs are normal with a   
mean of $400,000 and a standard deviation of $25,000;   
and unit costs are triangular with a minimum of $22.00,   
most likely value of $24.00, and maximum value of   
$30.00. Simulate 100 trials for production quantities

The Miller-Orr model in finance addresses a firm's   
problem of managing its cash position by purchasing   
or selling securities at a transaction cost in order to   
lower or raise its cash position. That is, the firm needs   
to have enough cash on hand to meet its obligations,   
but does not want to maintain too high a cash balance   
because it loses the opportunity for earning higher   
interest by investing in other securities. The Miller-Orr   
model assumes that the firm will maintain a minimum   
cash balance,

*m*

, a maximum cash balance,

*M*

, and an

ideal level,

*R*

, called the return point. Cash is managed

using a decision rule that states that whenever the cash   
balance falls to

*m*

,

*R*

-

*m*

securities are sold to bring

the balance up to the return point. When the cash bal-  
ance rises to

*M*

,

*M*

-

*R*

securities are purchased to

reduce the cash balance back to the return point. Using   
some advanced mathematics, the return point and   
maximum cash balance levels are shown to be

To apply the model, note that we do not need to know   
the actual demand for cash, only the daily variance.   
Essentially, the Miller-Orr model determines the deci-  
sion rule that minimizes the expected costs of mak-  
ing the cash-security transactions and the expected   
opportunity costs of maintaining the cash balance   
based on the variance of the cash requirements.  
Suppose that the daily requirements are normally   
distributed with a mean of 0 and variance of $60,000.   
Assume a transaction cost equal to $35, interest rate   
premium of 4%, and required minimum balance of   
$7,500. Develop a spreadsheet implementation for this   
model. Apply Monte-Carlo simulation to simulate the   
cash balance over the next year (365 days). Your sim-  
ulation should apply the decision rule that if the cash   
balance for the current day is less than or equal to the   
minimum level, sell securities to bring the balance up to   
the return point. Otherwise, if the cash balance exceeds   
the upper limit, buy enough securities (that is, subtract   
an amount of cash) to bring the balance back down to   
the return point. If neither of these conditions hold, then   
there is no transaction and the balance for the next day   
is simply the current value plus the net requirement.   
Show the cash balance results on a line chart.

service time of 1/3 minute). Simulate the arrival of 100   
customers. Use data tables to find the distributions for   
the maximum number in the queue, maximum waiting   
time, average waiting time per customer, and total idle   
time. Use 100 trials for each. What happens when the   
arrival rate approaches the service rate?

In one of PLE's manufacturing facilities, a drill press that   
has three drill bits is used to fabricate metal parts. Drill   
bits break occasionally and need to be replaced. The pres-  
ent policy is to replace a drill bit when it breaks or can   
no longer be used. The operations manager is considering   
a different policy in which all three drill bits are replaced   
when any one bit breaks or needs replacement. The ratio-  
nale is that this would reduce downtime. It costs $200 each   
time the drill press must be shut down. A drill bit costs   
$85, and the variable cost of replacing a drill bit is $15

per bit. The company that supplies the drill bits has his-  
torical evidence that the reliability of a single drill bit is   
described by a Poisson probability distribution with the   
mean number of failures per hour equal to

l

=

0.01. Thus,

the time between failures is an exponential distribution   
with mean

tions manager at PLE would like to compare the cost of   
the two replacement policies. Develop spreadsheet simula-  
tion models to determine the total cost for each policy over   
1,000 hours and make a recommendation.

Chapter 13

Linear Optimization

Up to now, we have concentrated on the role of descriptive analytics and pre-

dictive analytics in managerial decisions. In every area of business, managers

want to make the best possible decisions. For example, marketing analysts want

to choose the best advertising to attract the most customers; finance manag-

ers want to set the best prices to maximize profit; operations managers need to

determine the best inventory and production policies. In your own life, you might

want to find the best route for vacation travel (thank you, Google maps) or deter-

mine the best players for a fantasy sports team.

While many decisions involve only a limited number of alternatives and can

be addressed using statistical analysis, simple spreadsheet models, or simula-

tion, others have a very large or even an infinite number of possibilities. We intro-

duced optimization---the fundamental tool in pr[escriptive analytics---in Chapter 1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#30)

Optimization

is the process of selecting values of decision variables that

mini-

mize

or

maximize

some quantity of interest and is the most important tool for

prescriptive analytics.

Optimization models have been used extensively in operations and supply

chains, finance, marketing, and other disciplines for more than 50 years to help

managers allocate resources more efficiently and make lower-cost or more- profitable

decisions. Optimization is a very broad and complex topic; in this chapter, we focus

on formulating and solving many practical optimization models in business.

[Optimization Models](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

There are three basic types of optimization models: linear, integer, and nonlinear. A

**linear**

**optimization model**

(often called a

**linear program**

, or

**LP model**

) has two basic proper-

ties. First, the objective function and all constraints are linear functions of the decision   
variables. This means that each function is simply a sum of terms, each of which is some   
constant multiplied by a decision variable, such as 5

*x*

+

4

*y*

. Linear optimization models

are easy to solve using highly efficient solution algorithms. The second property of a linear   
optimization model is that all variables are continuous, meaning that they may assume   
any real value (typically, nonnegative, that is, greater than or equal to zero). Of course,   
this assumption may not be realistic for a practical business problem (you cannot produce   
half a refrigerator). However, because this assumption simplifies the solution method and   
analysis, we often apply it in many situations where the solution would not be seriously   
affected. For example, in deciding on the optimal number of cases of diapers to produce   
next month, we could use a linear model, since rounding a value like 5,621.63 would have   
little impact on the results. However, in a production-planning decision involving low-  
volume, high-cost items such as airplanes, an optimal value of 10.42 would make little   
sense, and a difference of one unit (rounded up or down) could have significant economic   
and production planning consequences.

In an

**integer linear optimization model**

(also called an

**integer program**

, or

**IP**

**model**

), some of or all the variables are restricted to being whole numbers. A special type

of integer problem is one in which variables can be only 0 or 1; these are used to model  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive496.png)

logical yes-or-no decisions. Integer linear optimization models are generally more difficult   
to solve than pure linear optimization models, but have many important applications in   
areas such as scheduling and supply chains.

Finally, there are many situations in which the relationship among variables in a

model is not linear. Whenever either the objective function or a constraint is not linear, we   
have a

**nonlinear optimization model**

(also called a

**nonlinear program**

, or

**NLP model**

).

In a nonlinear optimization model, the objective function and/or constraint functions are   
nonlinear functions of the decision variables; that is, terms cannot be written as a constant   
multiplied by a variable. Some examples of nonlinear terms are 3

*x*

2

, 4

\>

*y*

, and 6

*xy*

. Building

nonlinear optimization models requires more creativity and analytical expertise than linear   
or integer models; they also require different solution techniques. We will address inte-  
ger and nonlinear models in the next chapter. Nonlinear models may also include integer   
restrictions; these are among the most difficult types of optimization models to solve. In   
this chapter, we will focus exclusively on linear optimization.

Linear optimization models are the most ubiquitous of optimization models used in

organizations today. Applications abound in operations, finance, marketing, engineering,   
and many other discipl[ines. Table 13.1 summarizes some common types of generic l](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#496)inear   
optimization models. This list represents but a very small sample of the many practical   
types of linear optimization models that are used in practice throughout business. We will   
see examples of many of these later in this chapter.

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

The National Broadcasting Company (NBC), a subsidiary   
of General Electric, is primarily in the business of deliver-  
ing eyeballs (audiences) to advertisers. NBC's television   
network, cable network, TV stations, and Internet divi-  
sions generate billions of dollars in revenues. Of these, the   
television network business is by far the largest.

The television broadcast year in the United States

starts in the third week of September. The broadcast net-  
works announce their programming schedules for the new   
broadcast year in the middle of May. Shortly after that, the   
sale of inventory (advertising slots) begins. The broadcast   
networks sell about 60% to 80% of their airtime inven-  
tory during a brief period starting in late May and lasting   
about two to three weeks. This sales period is known as

the up-front market. During this time, advertising agencies   
approach the TV networks with requests to purchase time for   
their clients for the entire season. A typical request consists   
of the dollar amount, the demographic (for example, adults   
between 18 and 49 years of age) in which the client is inter-  
ested, the program mix, weekly weighting, unit-length distri-  
bution, and a negotiated cost per 1,000 viewers. NBC must   
develop a detailed sales plan consisting of the schedule of   
commercials to be aired to meet the requirements. In addi-  
tion, the plan should also meet the objectives of NBC's sales   
management, whose goal is to maximize the revenues for the   
available fixed amount of inventory.

Traditionally, NBC developed sales plans manually. This

process was laborious, taking several hours. Moreover, most

plans required a great deal of rework because, owing to   
their complexity, they initially met neither management's   
goals nor the customer's requirements. NBC developed   
a system using linear optimization that would generate   
sales plans quickly in a manner that made optimal use of   
the available inventory. The sales-planning problem was   
to minimize the amount of premium inventory assigned   
to a plan and the total penalty incurred in meeting goals,   
while meeting constraints on inventory, airtime avail-  
ability, product conflicts, client requirements, budget,   
show mix, weekly weighting, and unit mix. The decision   
variables are the numbers of commercials of each spot   
length requested by the client that are to be placed in the   
shows and weeks included in the sales plan. The objective   
function includes a term that represents the total value of

inventory assigned to the sales plan and terms that measure   
the penalties incurred in not meeting the client requirements   
these systems have provided.

The model and its implementation have saved mil-

lions of dollars of good inventory for NBC while meeting all   
the customer requirements; increased revenues; reduced   
the time needed to produce a sales plan from three to   
four hours to about 20 minutes; helped NBC to respond   
quickly to agencies and secure a greater share of the avail-  
able money in the market; helped NBC sales managers to   
resolve deals more quickly than in the past and better read   
the market, resulting in a more accurate prediction of the   
upfront outcome; decreased rework on plans by more than   
80%; and increased NBC's revenues by at least $50 million   
a year.

[Developing Linear Optimization Models](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

Any optimization model has the following elements:

**1.**

Decision variables

**2.**

An objective to maximize or minimize

**3.**

Constraints

**Decision variables**

in an optimization model are the unknown values that the model seeks

to determine. Depending on the application, decision variables might be the quantities of   
different products to produce, the amount of money spent on R\&D projects, the amount   
to ship from a warehouse to a customer, the amount of shelf space to devote to a product,   
and so on. The quantity we seek to minimize or maximize is called the

**objective func-**

**tion**

; for example, we might wish to maximize profit or revenue, or minimize cost or some

measure of risk.

**Constraints**

are limitations, requirements, or other restrictions that are

imposed on any solution, either from practical or technological considerations or by man-  
agement policy. The presence of constraints along with a large number of variables usu-  
ally makes identifying an optimal solution considerably more difficult and necessitates the   
use of powerful software tools. The essence of building an optimization model is to first   
identify these model components, and then translate the objective function and constraints   
into mathematical expressions. Managers can generally describe the decisions they have   
to make, the performance measures they use to evaluate the success of their decisions, and   
the limitations and requirements they face or must ensure rather easily in plain language.   
The task of the analyst is to take this information and extract the key elements that form the   
basis for developing a model.

Developing any optimization model consists of three basic steps:

**1.**

Identify the decision variables, the objective, and all appropriate constraints.

**2.**

Write the objective and constraints as mathematical expressions to create a   
mathematical model of the problem.

Chapter 13

Linear Optimization

We will begin with a simple scenario to illustrate the development and spreadsheet

implementation of a linear optimization model. Sklenka Ski Company (SSC) is a small   
manufacturer of two types of popular all-terrain snow skis, the Jordanelle and the Deercrest   
models. The manufacturing process consists of two principal departments: fabrication and   
finishing. The fabrication department has 12 skilled workers, each of whom works seven   
hours per day. The finishing department has three workers, who also work a seven-hour shift.   
Each pair of Jordanelle skis requires 3.5 labor-hours in the fabricating department and 1   
labor-hour in finishing. The Deercrest model requires 4 labor-hours in fabricating and 1.5   
labor-hours in finishing. The company operates five days per week. SSC makes a net profit   
of $50 on the Jordanelle model and $65 on the Deercrest model. In anticipation of the next   
ski-sale season, SSC must plan its production of these two models. Because of the popularity   
of its products and limited production capacity, its products are in high demand, and SSC can   
sell all it can produce each season. The company anticipates selling at least twice as many   
Deercrest models as Jordanelle models. The company wants to determine how many of each   
model should be produced on a daily basis to maximize net profit.

[Identifying Decision Variables, the Objective, and Constraints](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

The first thing to do is to read the problem statement carefully and identify the decision   
variables, objective, and constraints in plain language before attempting to develop a math-  
ematical model or a spreadsheet.

EXAMPLE 13.1

Sklenka Ski Company: Identifying Model Components

Step 1.

Identify the decision variables.

SSC makes

two different models of skis. The decisions are   
stated clearly: how many of each model ski   
should be produced each day? Thus, we may   
define

Jordanelle

=

Number of pairs of Jordanelle  
skis produced

\>

day

Deercrest

=

Number of pairs of Deercrest  
skis produced

\>

day

It is very important to clearly specify the dimensions of the   
variables, for example, "pairs of skis produced/day" rather   
than simply "Jordanelle skis."

Step 2.

Identify the objective function.

The problem

states that SSC wishes to maximize net profit,   
and we are given the net profit figures for each   
type of ski. In some problems, the objective is   
not explicitly stated, and we must use logic and   
business experience to identify the appropriate   
objective.

Step 3.

Identify the constraints.

To identify constraints,

look for clues in the problem statement that

describe limited resources that are available,   
requirements that must be met, or other   
restrictions. In this example, we see that both the   
fabrication and finishing departments have limited   
numbers of workers, who work only seven hours   
each day; this limits the amount of production   
time available in each department. Therefore, we   
have the following constraints:

Fabrication:

Total labor-hours used in fabrication

cannot exceed the amount of labor-hours available.

Finishing:

Total labor-hours used in finishing cannot

exceed the amount of labor-hours available.

In addition, the company anticipates selling at least   
twice as many Deercrest models as Jordanelle   
models. Thus, we need a constraint that states

Number of pairs of Deercrest skis must be at least   
twice the number of parts of Jordanelle skis.

Finally, we must ensure that negative values of the   
decision variables cannot occur. Nonnegativity   
constraints are assumed in nearly all optimization   
models.

EXAMPLE 13.2

Sklenka Ski Company: Modeling the Objective Function

The decision variables are the number of pairs of   
each type of ski to produce each day. Because SSC   
makes a net profit of $50 on the Jordanelle model and   
$65 on the Deercrest model, then, for example, if we   
produce 10 pairs of Jordanelle skis and 20 pairs of   
Deercrest skis during one day, we would make a profit   
of

1

$

50/pair of Jordanelle skis

21

10 pairs of Jordanelle

skis

2

+

1

$

65/pair of Jordanelle skis

21

20 pairs of

Deercrest skis

2

=

$

500

+

$

1,300

=

$

1,800. Because we

don't know how many pairs of skis to produce, we write   
each term of the objective function by multiplying the unit   
profit by the decision variables we have defined:

Maximize Total Profit

=

$

50 Jordanelle

+

$

65 Deercrest

Note how the dimensions verify that the expression is   
correct:

1

$

\>

21

number of pairs of skis

=

$

.

Constraints are generally expressed mathematically as algebraic inequalities or equa-

tions with all variables on the left side and constant terms on the right (this facilitates solv-  
ing the model on a spreadsheet, as we will discuss later). To model the constraints, we use   
a similar approach. First, consider the fabrication and finishing constraints. We expressed   
these constraints as

*Fabrication:*

Total labor-hours used in fabrication cannot exceed the amount of labor

hours available.

*Finishing:*

Total labor-hours used in finishing cannot exceed the amount of labor

hours available.

First, note that the phrase "cannot exceed" translates mathematically as "

...

." In other con-

straints, we might find the phrase "at least," which would translate as "

Ú

" or "must contain

exactly," which would specify an "

=

" relationship. All constraints in optimization models

must be one of these three forms.

Second, note that "cannot exceed" divides each constraint into two parts---the left-

hand side ("total labor-hours used") and the right-hand side ("amount of labor-hours avail-  
able"). The left-hand side of each of these expressions is called a

**constraint function**

.

A constraint function is a function of the decision variables in the problem. The right-  
hand sides are numerical values (although occasionally they may be constraint functions as   
well). All that remains is to translate both the constraint functions and the right-hand sides   
into mathematical expressions.

[Developing a Mathematical Model](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

The challenging part of developing optimization models is translating the descrip-  
tions of the objective and constraints into mathematical expressions. We usually rep-  
resent decision variables by descriptive names (such as Jordanelle and Deercrest),   
abbreviations, or subscripted letters such as

*X*

1

and

*X*

2

. For mathematical formulations

involving many variables, subscripted letters are often more convenient; however, in   
spreadsheet models, we recommend using descriptive names to make the models and   
solutions easier to understand. In [Example 13.2,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#499) we show the importance of specifying   
the dimension of the decision variables. This is extremely helpful to ensure the accu-  
racy of the model.

EXAMPLE 13.3

Sklenka Ski Company: Modeling the Constraints

The amount of labor available in fabrication is (12 workers)

\*

(7 hours/day)

=

84 hours/day, whereas in finishing we

have (3 workers)

\*

(7 hours/day)

=

21 hours/day. Because

each pair of Jordanelle skis requires 3.5 labor-hours and   
each pair of Deercrest skis requires 4 labor-hours in the   
fabricating department, the total labor used in fabrication is   
3.5 Jordanelle

+

4 Deercrest. Note that the dimensions

of these terms are (hours/pair of skis)(number of pairs  
of skis produced per day)

=

hours. Similarly, for

the finishing department, the total labor used is   
1 Jordanelle

+

1.5 Deercrest. Therefore, the appropriate

constraints are:

Fabrication: 3.5 Jordanelle

+

4 Deercrest

...

84

Finishing: 1 Jordanelle

+

1.5 Deercrest

...

21

For the market mixture constraint "Number of pairs of   
Deercrest skis must be at least twice the number of pairs of   
Jordanelle skis," we have

Deercrest

Ú

2 Jordanelle

It is customary to write all the variables on the left-hand   
side of the constraint. Thus, an alternative expression for   
this constraint is

Deercrest

-

2 Jordanelle

Ú

0

The difference between the number of Deercrest skis and   
twice the number of Jordanelle skis can be thought of as   
the excess number of Deercrest skis produced over the   
minimum market mixture requirement. Finally, nonnegativity   
constraints are written as

Deercrest

Ú

0

The most challenging aspect of model formulation is identifying constraints. Understand-  
ing the different types of constraints can help in proper identification and modeling. Con-  
straints generally fall into one of the following categories:

■

■

*Simple Bounds*

.

**Simple bounds**

constrain the value of a single variable. You can

recognize simple bounds in problem statements such as no more than $10,000   
may be invested in stock ABC, or we must produce at least 350 units of product   
Y to meet customer commitments this month.

■

■

*Limitations*

.

**Limitations**

usually involve the allocation of scarce resources. Prob-

lem statements such as the amount of material used in production cannot exceed   
the amount available in inventory, minutes used in assembly cannot exceed the   
available labor hours, or the amount shipped from the Austin plant in July cannot   
exceed the plant's capacity are typical of these types of constraints.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive502.png)

Chapter 13

Linear Optimization

473

■

■

*Requirements*

.

**Requirements**

involve the specification of minimum levels of per-

formance. Such statements as enough cash must be available in February to meet   
financial obligations, production must be sufficient to meet promised customer   
orders, or the marketing plan should ensure that at least 400 customers are con-  
tacted each month are some examples.

■

■

*Proportional Relationships*

.

**Proportional relationships**

are often found in prob-

lems involving mixtures or blends of materials or strategies. Examples include   
the amount invested in aggressive growth stocks cannot be more than twice the   
amount invested in equity-income funds, or a mixture of fertilizer must contain   
exactly 30% nitrogen.

■

■

*Balance Constraints*

.

**Balance constraints**

essentially state that input

=

output

and ensure that the flow of material or money is accounted for at locations or   
between time periods. Examples include production in June plus any available   
inventory must equal June's demand plus inventory held to July, the total amount   
shipped to a distribution center from all plants must equal the amount shipped from   
the distribution center to all customers, or the total amount of money invested or   
saved in March must equal the amount of money available at the end of February.

EXAMPLE 13.4

Modeling Constraints

We illustrate each of these types of constraints in the   
following examples.

1.

Simple bound: We must produce at least 350 units   
of product Y to meet customer commitments this   
month.

2.

Limitation: The amount of money spent on research and   
development projects cannot exceed the assigned bud-  
get of $300,000.

3.

Requirement: Contractual requirements specify that a   
total of at least 500 units of product must be shipped   
from factories in Austin and Atlanta.

4.

Proportional relationship: A mixture of fertilizer must   
contain exactly 30% nitrogen.

5.

Balance constraint: Available inventory and production   
in June must satisfy the demand of 150 units or be held   
over to July.

To model any constraint, first identify the phrase that

corresponds to either

...

,

Ú

, or

=

and substitute these

into the constraint. Thus, for these examples, we would   
write the following:

1.

Amount of product Y

Ú

350

2.

Amount spent on research and development

...

$

300,000

3.

Number of units of product shipped from Austin and   
Atlanta

Ú

500

4.

Amount of nitrogen in mixture/total amount in   
mixture

=

0.30

5.

Inventory and production in current month

=

demand

and inventory held over to the next month

Then it simply becomes an exercise to translate the words   
into mathematical expressions using the decision variables   
in the problem. For instance:

1.

Define

Product_Y

to be the number of units of product

Y produced. Then the constraint is

Product_Y

Ú

350

2.

Define

R\&DExpenses

to be the amount of money spent

on research and development projects. Then the con-  
straint is

R\&DExpenses

...

$

300,000

3.

Define

X

1

=

amount shipped from Austin and

X

2

=

amount shipped from Atlanta. Then the constraint

is

X

1

+

X

2

Ú

500

4.

Suppose that two ingredients contain 20% and 33%   
nitrogen, respectively; then the fraction of nitrogen in a   
mixture of

x

pounds of the first ingredient and

y

pounds

of the second ingredient is expressed by

0.20

x

+

0.33

y

x

+

y

.

If the fraction of nitrogen in the mixture must be 0.30,   
then we would have

0.20

x

+

0.33

y

x

+

y

=

0.3. Note that this

constraint is actually nonlinear. However, we can con-  
vert it to a linear form using simple algebra. This can be   
rewritten as 0.20

x

+

0.33

y

=

0.3(

x

+

y

) and simplified

as

-

0.1

x

+

0.03

y

=

0.

5.

Define

I_June

=

inventory available in June,

I_July

=

inven-

tory held over to July, and

P_June

=

production in June.

Then the constraint is

I_June

+

P_June

=

150

+

I_July

.

Chapter 13

Linear Optimization

Constraints in linear optimization models are generally some combination of con-

straints from these categories. Problem data or verbal clues in a problem statement often   
help you identify the appropriate constraint. In some situations, all constraints may not be   
explicitly stated, but are required for the model to represent the real problem accurately. An   
example of an implicit constraint is nonnegativity of the decision variables.

[Implementing Linear Optimization Models on Spreadsheets](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

We will learn how to solve optimization models using an Excel tool called

*Solver*

. To

facilitate the use of

*Solver*

, we suggest the following spreadsheet engineering guidelines

for designing spreadsheet models for optimization problems:

■

■

*Put the objective function coefficients, constraint coefficients, and right-hand
values in a logical format in the spreadsheet*

. For example, you might assign the

decision variables to columns and the constraints to rows, much like the math-  
ematical formulation of the model, and input the model parameters in a matrix. If   
you have many more variables than constraints, it might make sense to use rows   
for the variables and columns for the constraints.

■

■

*Define a set of cells (either rows or columns) for the values of the decision vari-
ables*

. In some models, it may be necessary to define a matrix to represent the

decision variables. The names of the decision variables should be listed directly   
above the decision variable cells. Use shading or other formatting to distinguish   
these cells.

■

■

*Define separate cells for the objective function and each constraint function (the
left-hand side of a constraint)*

. Use descriptive labels directly above these cells.

A Spreadsheet Model for Sklenka Skis

example. (Excel file

solution. Typically, you would start with all decision   
variables equal to zero as shown in[Figure 13.1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#504)). We use the   
principles of spreadsheet The engineering that we discussed   
in [Chapter 2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#76) to implement the model. The

Data

portion of

the spreadsheet provides the objective function coefficients,   
constraint coefficients, and right-hand sides of the model.   
Such data should be kept separate from the actual model so   
that if any data are changed, the model will automatically be   
updated. In the

Model

section, the number of each product

to make is given in cells B14 and C14. Also in the

Model

section are calculations for the constraint functions,

and the objective function, 50 Jordanelle

Sklenka Skis Model Spreadsheet Implementation

Observe how the constraint functions and right-hand-side values are stored in separate   
cells within the spreadsheet.

In Excel, the pairwise sum of products of terms can easily be computed using the

SUMPRODUCT function. For example, the objective function

=

B9\*B14

+

C9\*C14 is equivalent to

=

SUMPRODUCT

1

B9:C9, B14:C14

Similarly, for the labor limitation constraints

=

B6\*B14

+

C6\*C14 is equivalent to

=

SUMPRODUCT

1

B6:C6, B14:C14

2

=

B7\*B14

+

C7\*C14 is equivalent to

=

SUMPRODUCT

1

B7:C7, B14:C14

2

The SUMPRODUCT function often simplifies the model-building process, particularly   
when many variables are involved.

We should note that optimization models that we develop can be used in all phases of

analytics---descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. For example, we can use the model to   
evaluate the profit and utilization of resources in a descriptive setting to answer the ques-  
tion "What are we doing now?" We might use the model in a predictive setting to evaluate   
forecasted cost increases or the effects of inflation in the future. Finally, we can ask "What   
is the best we can do with our current resources?" In this way, the model can be used as a   
prescriptive model.

[Excel Functions to Avoid in Linear Optimization](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

Several common functions in Excel can cause difficulties when attempting to solve linear   
programs using

*Solver*

because they are discontinuous (or "nonsmooth") and do not satisfy

the conditions of a linear model. For instance, in the formula IF(A12

6

45, 0, 1), the cell

value jumps from 0 when the value of cell A12 is less than 45, to 1 when the value of cell   
A12 is 45 or more. In such situations, the correct solution may not be identified. Common   
Excel functions to avoid are ABS, MIN, MAX, INT, ROUND, IF, and COUNT. Although   
these are useful in general modeling tasks with spreadsheets, you should avoid them in   
linear optimization models.

To solve an optimization problem, we seek values of the decision variables that maximize   
or minimize the objective function and also satisfy all constraints. Any solution that satis-  
fies all constraints of a problem is called a

**feasible solution**

. Finding an optimal solution

among the infinite number of possible feasible solutions to a given problem is not an easy   
task. A simple approach is to try to manipulate the decision variables in the spreadsheet   
model to find the best solution possible; however, for many problems, it might be very dif-  
ficult to find a feasible solution, let alone an optimal solution. You might try to find the best   
solution you can for the Sklenka Ski problem by using the spreadsheet model. With a little   
experimentation and perhaps a bit of luck, you might be able to zero in on the optimal solu-  
tion or something close to it. However, to guarantee finding an optimal solution, some type   
of systematic mathematical solution procedure is necessary. Fortunately, such a procedure   
is provided by the Excel

tool, which we discuss next.

Values

state that we used 60.375 hours in the fabrication

department and 21 hours in the finishing department by   
producing 5.25 pairs of Jordanelle skis and 10.5 pairs of   
Deercrest skis. You may easily identify the constraints from   
the spreadsheet model in the Formulas column. From the   
Status column, we see that the constraint for fabrication   
is not binding, although the constraints for finishing and   
market mixture are binding. This means that there is

excess time that is not used in fabrication; this value is   
shown in the Slack column as 23.626 hours. For finishing,   
we used all the time available; hence, the slack value is   
zero. Because we produced exactly twice the number   
of Deercrest skis as Jordanelle skis, the market mixture   
constraint is binding. It would not have been binding if we   
had produced more than twice the number of Deercrest   
skis as Jordanelle.

To understand the value of slack better, examine the

fabrication constraint:

We can easily illustrate optimization problems with two decision variables graphically.   
This can help you to better understand the properties of linear optimization models and the   
interpretation of the

*Solver*

output. Recall that a feasible solution is a set of values for the

decision variables that satisfy all of the constraints. Linear programs generally have an infi-  
nite number of feasible solutions. We first characterize the set of feasible solutions, often   
called the

**feasible region**

. We use the SSC model to illustrate this graphical approach:

Taken together, these nonnegativity restrictions imply that any feasible solution must be   
restricted to the first (upper-right) quadrant of the coordinate system. This is true for the   
feasible solutions to the SSC problem.

You are probably very familiar with equations in two dimensions, which define points

on a line. An inequality constraint divides the coordinate system into two regions, the set   
of points that do satisfy the inequality and the set of points that don't. In two dimensions,   
an equality constraint is simply a line. To graph a line in two dimensions, we need to find   
two points that lie on the line. As long as the right-hand side term is not zero, the two points   
that are easiest to find are the

*x*

@

and

*x*

2

@

intercepts (the points where the line crosses the

*x*

. Likewise, to find the

EXAMPLE 13.8

Graphing the Constraints in the SSC Problem

The fabrication constraint is 3.5 Jordanelle

+

4 Deercrest

...

84. Whenever a constraint is in the

form of an inequality (that is,

Ú

or

...

type), we first

graph the equation of the line by replacing the inequality   
sign with an equal sign. Therefore, we graph the   
equation 3.5 Jordanelle

+

4 Deercrest

=

84. If we set

Jordanelle

=

0, then solving the equation for Deercrest

yields Deercrest

=

21. Similarly, if we set Deercrest

=

0,

we find that Jordanelle

=

24. This gives us two points,

(0, 21) and (24, 0), on the coordinate system and defines   
[the equation of the straight line, as shown in Figure 13.7.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#510)

However, the actual constraint is an inequality;

therefore, all the points on one side of the line will satisfy the   
constraint, but points on the other side will not. To identify   
the proper direction, simply select any point not on the line---  
the easiest one to choose is the origin, (0, 0)---and determine   
if that point satisfies the constraint. If it does, then all points   
on that side of the line will also satisfy the constraint; if not,   
then all points on the

other

side of the line must satisfy the

constraint. Clearly, 3.5

1

0

2

+

4

1

0

2

=

0

6

84; therefore,

all points below the constraint line satisfy the inequality. In   
mathematical terms, the set of points on one side of a line is   
called a

half-space

. Only points lying in this half-space can

be potential solutions to the optimization model.

To graph the finishing constraint 1 Jordanelle

+

1.5 Deercrest

...

21, we follow the same procedure.

Set Jordanelle

=

0 and solve for Deercrest, obtaining

Deercrest

=

14; set Deercrest

=

0 and solve for Jordanelle,

obtaining Jordanelle

=

21. Choosing the origin again

verifies that all points below the line satisfy the inequality   
[constraint. This is shown in Figure 13.8.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#511)

The third constraint is the market mix constraint:

Deercrest

-

2 Jordanelle

Ú

0. If we try to set each variable

in the equation Deercrest

-

2 Jordanelle

=

0 to zero and

solve for the other, we end up with (0, 0) each time because   
the equation of the line passes through the origin. When   
this occurs, we need to select a different value for one of   
the variables to identify a second point on the line. For   
example, if we set Jordanelle

=

5, then Deercrest

=

10.

Now we have two points, (0, 0) and (5, 10), which we can   
[use to graph the equation (see Figure 13.9). However, since](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#512)the line passes through the origin, we cannot determine the   
proper half-space using the origin (0, 0). Instead, choose   
any other point not on the line. For example, if we choose   
the point (2, 10), which is on the left side of the line, we   
see that Deercrest

-

2 Jordanelle

=

10

-

2(2)

=

6

7

0;

therefore, all points to the left of the line satisfy   
the inequality constraint. Had we chosen a point   
on the right, say, (5, 2), we would have found that   
Deercrest

-

2 Jordanelle

=

2

-

2(5)

=

-

8

6

0, which

does not satisfy the inequality.

After graphing each of the constraints, we identify the feasible region. For a linear

optimization problem, the feasible region will be some geometric shape that is bounded by   
straight lines. The points at which the constraint lines intersect along the feasible region   
are called

**corner points**

. One of the important properties of linear optimization models is

that if an optimal solution exists, then it will occur at a corner point. This makes it easy to   
identify optimal solutions and is the basis for the computational procedure used by

*Solver*

.

EXAMPLE 13.9

Identifying the Feasible Region and Optimal Solution

The feasible region is the set of points that satisfy all   
[constraints simultaneously. From Figure 13.9, we see](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#512)that the feasible region must be below the fabrication   
constraint line, below the finishing constraint line, to the   
left of the market mix constraint line, and, of course,   
within the first quadrant defined by the nonnegativity   
constraints. This is shown by the triangular region in   
[Figure 13.10. Notice that every point that satisfies the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#512)finishing constraint also satisfies the fabrication constraint.   
In this case, we say that the fabrication constraint is a

redundant constraint

because it does not impact the

feasible region at all.

Because our objective is to maximize profit, we seek

a corner point that has the largest value of the objective   
function total profit

=

50 Jordanelle

+

65 Deercrest.

Note that if we set the objective function to any numerical   
value, we define a straight line. For example, if we set   
50 Jordanelle

+

65 Deercrest

=

600, then any point on

[this line will have a total profit of $600. Figure 13.11 shows](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#513)the dashed-line graphs of the objective function for profit   
values of $600, $800, and $1,000. Notice that as the profit   
increases, the graph of the objective function moves in an   
upward direction. However, for a profit of $1,000, no points

on the line also pass through the feasible region. From the   
figure, then, we can conclude that the maximum profit must   
be somewhere between $800 and $1,000.

We also see that as the profit increases, the last

point in the feasible region that the profit lines will cross   
is the corner point on the right side of the triangle,   
identified by the circle in [Figure 13.11.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#513) This must be the   
optimal solution. This point is the intersection of the   
finishing and market mix constraint lines. We can find this   
point mathematically by solving these constraint lines   
simultaneously:

1 Jordanelle

+

1.5 Deercrest

=

21

Deercrest

-

2 Jordanelle

=

0

From the second equation, we have Deercrest

=

2 Jordanelle;

substituting this into the first equation, we obtain

1 Jordanelle

+

1.5(2 Jordanelle)

=

21

4 Jordanelle

=

21

Jordanelle

=

5.25

Then Deercrest

=

10.5. This is exactly the

*Solver*

uses a mathematical algorithm called the

*simplex method*

, which was developed in

1947 by the late Dr. George Dantzig. The simplex method characterizes feasible solutions   
algebraically by solving systems of linear equations. It moves systematically from one   
corner point to another to improve the objective function until an optimal solution is found   
(or until the problem is deemed infeasible or unbounded). Because of the linearity of the   
constraints and objective function, the simplex method is guaranteed to find an optimal   
solution if one exists and usually does so quickly and efficiently. To gain some intuition   
into the logic of

*Solver*

, consider the following example.

EXAMPLE 13.11

Solving the Crebo Manufacturing Model

In the

Crebo Manufacturing Model

, compute the ratio of

the gross margin/unit to the minutes per unit of machining   
[capacity used, as shown in row 6 in Figure 13.12 (Excel](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#515)file

Crebo Manufacturing Model

). These ratios can be

interpreted as the marginal profit per unit of resource

consumed. The highest ratio occurs for clips. If we produce   
the maximum number of clips, 280,000

\>

2

=

140,000, the

total profit is

$

1.20(140,000)

=

$

168,000. The mathematics

gets complicated with more constraints and requires   
multiple iterations to systematically improve the solution.

To solve this problem, your first thought might be to choose the variable with the high-

est marginal profit. Because

*X*

2

has the highest marginal profit, you might try producing as

many rails as possible. Since each rail requires 2.5 minutes, the maximum number that can   
be produced is 280,000

\>

2.5

=

112,000, for a total profit of $1.3

1

112,000

2

=

$145,600.

However, notice that each rail uses a lot more machining time than the other products. The   
best solution isn't necessarily the one with the highest marginal profit, but the one that pro-  
vides the highest

*total*

profit. Therefore, more profit might be realized by producing a pro-

portionately larger quantity of a different product having a smaller marginal profit. This is the   
key insight. What the simplex method essentially does is evaluate the impact of constraints   
in terms of their contribution to the objective function for each variable. For the simple case   
of only one constraint, the optimal (maximum) solution is found by simply choosing the   
variable with the highest ratio of the objective coefficient to the constraint coefficient.

EXAMPLE 13.10

Crebo Manufacturing

Crebo Manufacturing produces four types of structural   
support fittings---plugs, rails, rivets, and clips---which are   
machined on two CNC machining centers. The machining   
centers have a capacity of 280,000 minutes per year. The   
gross margin per unit and machining requirements are   
provided in the table below.

Linear Optimization

If we apply similar logic to the SSC problem, we would at first want to produce as

many Deercrest skis as possible because they have the largest profit contribution. So for   
example, if we do, we find that the constraints limit us to the minimum of 84

4

=

21 units

(from the fabrication constraint) or 21

\>

1.5

=

14 (from the finishing constraint). Note that

producing 14 Deercrest skis will also satisfy the market mix constraint. The total profit   
is $65

2

=

$910. However, note that finishing requires 50% more time for Deercrest

skis than for Jordanelle skis, so the profit contribution per finishing hour for Deercrest is   
only $65

\>

1.5

=

$43.33, so on a relative basis, the Jordanelle skis are more profitable.

Thus, for example, if we produce 1 Jordanelle ski, we can produce 20

13.33 Deer-

crest skis, for a total profit of $50

$65

=

$916.67, an increase of $6.67.

Similarly, if we produce 2 Jordanelle skis, we can produce 12.67 Deercrest with a total   
profit of $923.33. If we continue to produce more Jordanelle skis, the profit will continue   
to increase, but the ratio of Jordanelle to Deercrest also gets larger, and eventually we will   
violate the market mix constraint. This occurs when more than 5.25 Jordanelle skis are   
produced. At this point, we have the maximum profit.

Of course, for problems involving many constraints, it is difficult to apply such intui-

tive logic. The simplex method allows many real business problems involving thousands or   
even millions of variables---and often hundreds or thousands of constraints---to be solved   
in reasonable computational time and is the basis for advanced optimization algorithms   
involving integer variables that we describe in the next chapter.

How you design your spreadsheet model will affect how

creates the names used in

the output reports. Poor spreadsheet design can make it difficult or confusing to interpret the   
Answer and other

*Solver*

reports. Thus, it is important to understand how to do this properly.

*Solver*

assigns names to target cells, changing cells, and constraint function cells by con-

catenating the text in the first cell containing text to the left of the cell with the first cell con-  
taining text above it. For example, in the SSC model in[Figure 13.1,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#504) the target cell is D22. The   
first cell containing text to the left of D22 is "Profit Contribution" in A22, and the first cell   
containing text above D22 is "Total Profit" in cell D21. Concatenating these text strings yields   
the target cell name "Profit Contribution Total Profit," which is found in the

*Solver*

reports.

The constraint functions are calculated in cells D15 and D16. Note that their report names are   
"Fabrication Hours Used" and "Finishing Hours Used." Similarly, the changing cells in B14   
and C14 have the names "Quantity Produced Jordanelle" and "Quantity Produced Deercrest."   
These names make it easy to interpret the information in the Answer and Sensitivity Reports.   
We encourage you to examine each of the target cells, changing variable cells, and constraint   
function cells in your models carefully so that report names are properly established.

Solving a linear optimization model can result in four possible outcomes:

a unique optimal solution

**2.**

alternative (multiple) optimal solutions

**3.**

an unbounded solution

**4.**

infeasibility

[Unique Optimal Solution](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

When a model has a

**unique optimal solution**

, it means that there is exactly one solution

that will result in the maximum (or minimum) objective. The solution to the SSC model   
is unique; there are no solutions other than producing 5.25 pairs of Jordanelle skis and   
10.5 pairs of Deercrest skis that result in the maximum profit of $945. We could see this   
[graphically in Figure 13.11 because there is a unique corner point that l](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#513)ies on the objective   
function line at the optimal value of profit.

[Alternative (Multiple) Optimal Solutions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

If a model has

**alternative optimal solutions**

, the objective is maximized (or minimized)

by more than one combination of decision variables, all of which have the same objective   
function value.

*Solver*

does not tell you when alternative solutions exist and reports only

one of the many possible alternative optimal solutions. However, you can use the Sensitiv-  
ity Report information to identify the existence of alternative optimal solutions. When any   
of the Allowable Increase or Allowable Decrease values for changing cells are zero, then   
alternative optimal solutions exist, although

*Solver*

does not provide an easy way to find

them.

EXAMPLE 13.12

A Model with Alternative Optimal Solutions

To illustrate a model with alternative optimal solutions,   
suppose we change the objective function in the SSC   
model to Max 50 Jordanelle

+

75 Deercrest. A solution

obtained using

Solver

[is shown in Figure 13.13, producing](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#517)

no Jordanelle skis and 14 pairs of Deercrest skis and   
resulting in a profit of $1,050. However, notice that the   
original optimal solution also has the same objective   
function value: profit

=

$

50(5.25)

+

$

75(10.5)

=

1,050.

[This may be seen graphically in Figure 13.14. The](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#517)

new objective function lines are parallel to the finishing

constraint line. Thus, as the profit increases, you can see   
that the profit line must stop along the top boundary of the   
feasible region defined by the finishing constraint. Both   
corner points that are circled are optimal solutions, as is   
any point connecting them. Therefore, when alternative   
optimal solutions exist, there actually are an infinite number   
of them; however, identifying them other than graphically   
requires some advanced analysis.

dialog; the mes-

sage "The objective (Set Cell) values do not converge" is an

indication that the solution is unbounded. This can easily be   
[seen graphically in Figure 13.16. Without the finishing and](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#519)fabrication constraints, the feasible region extends upward   
in the shaded triangular region with no limit. As the profit   
values increase, there are no boundary lines to stop the   
objective function from getting larger and larger. However,   
it is important to realize that even though the feasible region   
is unbounded, the problem can have a finite optimal solu-  
tion if the profit lines move in a different direction.

[Infeasibility](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#14)

Finally, an

**infeasible problem**

is one for which no feasible solution exists---that is, when

there is no solution that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. When a problem is infea-  
sible,

*Solver*

will report "Solver could not find a feasible solution." Infeasible problems

*can*

occur in practice---for example, when a demand requirement is higher than available

capacity or when managers in different departments have conflicting requirements or limi-  
tations. In such cases, the model must be reexamined and modified. Sometimes infeasibil-  
ity, or unboundedness, is simply a result of a misplaced decimal, an incorrect inequality   
sign, or other error in the model or spreadsheet implementation, so accuracy checks should   
be made.

Building optimization models is more of an art than a science because there often are sev-  
eral ways of formulating a particular problem. Learning how to build optimization models   
requires logical thought but can be facilitated by studying examples of different models   
and observing their characteristics. In this section, we illustrate examples of other types of   
linear optimization models and describe unique issues associated with formulation, spread-  
sheet implementation, and interpreting results.

Blending problems involve mixing several raw materials that have different characteristics   
to make a product that meets certain specifications. Dietary planning, gasoline and oil refin-  
ing, coal and fertilizer production, and the production of many other types of bulk com-  
modities involve blending. We typically see proportional constraints in blending models.

EXAMPLE 13.15

BG Seed Company

The BG Seed Company specializes in food products for   
birds and other household pets. In developing a new   
birdseed mix, company nutritionists have specified that   
the mixture should contain at least 13% protein and 15%   
fat and no more than 14% fiber. The percentages of each   
of these nutrients in eight types of ingredients that can   
[be used in the mix are given in Table 13.2, along with the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#521)wholesale cost per pound. What is the minimum-cost   
mixture that meets the stated nutritional requirements?

The decisions are the amount of each ingredient to

include in a given quantity---for example, 1 pound---of mix.   
Define

X

i

1 pound of the mix, for

i

, 8. Defining the variables

in this fashion makes the solution easily scalable to any   
quantity.

The objective is to minimize total cost, obtained by

multiplying the cost per pound by the number of pounds   
used for each ingredient:

To ensure that the mix contains the appropriate

proportion of ingredients, observe that multiplying the   
number of pounds of each ingredient by the percentage   
of nutrient in that ingredient (a dimensionless quantity)   
specifies the number of pounds of nutrient provided. For

example, sunflower seeds contain 16.9% protein; so

This proportion must be at least 0.13 and can be con-

, that

can help in understanding why. This is sho[wn in Figure 13.21. From this report, it appears](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#523)that a conflict exists in trying to meet both the fat and fiber constraints. If you look closely   
at the data, you can see that only sunflower seeds and safflower seeds have high enough   
amounts of fat needed to meet the 15% requirement; however, they also have very high   
amounts of fiber, so including them in the mixture makes it impossible to meet the fiber   
limitation.

So what should the company owner do? One option is to investigate other potential

ingredients to use in the mixture that have different nutritional characteristics and see if   
a feasible solution can be found. The second option is to either lower the fat requirement   
or raise the fiber limitation, recognizing that these are not ironclad constraints, but simply   
nutritional goals that can probably be modified in consultation with the company nutrition-  
ists. [Figure 13.22](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#523)shows

solutions to two what-if scenarios, where the fat require-

ment is lowered to 14.5%, and the fiber limitation is raised to 14.5%, with all other data   
remaining the same in each case. Feasible solutions were found for both cases, and there is   
little difference in the results.

This ensures that at least 13% of the mixture will be pro-  
tein. In a similar fashion, the constraints for the fat and fiber

EXAMPLE 13.16

Innis Investments

Innis Investments is a small, family-owned business that   
manages personal financial portfolios. The company   
manages six mutual funds and has a client who has   
acquired $500,000 from an inheritance. Characteristics of   
[the funds are given in Table 13.3.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#524)

Innis Investments uses a proprietary algorithm to

establish a measure of risk for its funds based on the   
historical volatility of the investments. The higher the   
volatility, the greater the risk. The company recommends   
that no more than $200,000 be invested in any individual   
fund, that at least $50,000 be invested in each of the   
multinational and balanced funds, and that the total amount   
invested in income equity and balanced funds be at least   
40% of the total investment, or $200,000. The client would   
like to have an average return of at least 5% but would like   
to minimize risk. What portfolio would achieve this?

Let

X

1

through

X

6

represent the dollar amount invested

in funds 1 through 6, respectively. The total risk would be   
measured by the weighted risk of the portfolio, where the   
weights are the proportion of the total investment in any   
fund (

500,000). Thus, the objective function is

A

*poorly scaled*

model is one that computes values of the objective, constraints, or inter-

mediate results that differ by several orders of magnitude. Because of the finite precision   
of computer arithmetic, when these values of very different magnitudes (or others derived   
from them) are added, subtracted, or compared---in the user's model or in the

*Solver*

's

own calculations---the result will be accurate to only a few significant digits. As a result,

*Solver*

may detect or suffer from "numerical instability." The effects of poor scaling in

an optimization model can be among the most difficult problems to identify and resolve.

In the

rescales the values of the objective and constraint functions internally

to minimize the effects of poor scaling. But this can only help with the

arise

*in the middle of your Excel formulas*

. The best way to avoid scaling problems is to

carefully choose the "units" implicitly used in your model so that all computed results are   
within a few orders of magnitude of each other. For example, if you express dollar amounts   
in units of (say) millions, the actual numbers computed on your worksheet may range from   
perhaps 1 to 1,000.

Many practical models in supply chain optimization stem from a very simple model called   
the

**transportation problem**

. This involves determining how much to ship from a set of

sources of supply (factories, warehouses, etc.) to a set of demand locations (warehouses,   
customers, etc.) at minimum cost.

the answer is incorrect! This occurs because the objective

[hundreds of thousands of dollars). Figure 13.26 shows](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#528)the result after

approach would be to scale the investment amount in the   
model as thousands of dollars (that is, replace cell C11   
with $350). Even without automatic scaling, this will yield   
the optimal solution. So check your models carefully for   
possible scaling issues!

EXAMPLE 13.18

General Appliance Corporation

General Appliance Corporation (GAC) produces   
refrigerators at two plants: Marietta, Georgia, and   
Minneapolis, Minnesota. They ship them to major   
distribution centers in Cleveland, Baltimore, Chicago,   
and Phoenix. The accounting, production, and marketing   
[departments have provided the information in Table 13.4,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#529)which shows the unit cost of shipping between any plant   
and distribution center, plant capacities over the next   
planning period, and distribution center demands. GAC's   
supply chain manager faces the problem of determining   
how much to ship between each plant and distribution   
center to minimize the total transportation cost, not exceed   
available capacity, and meet customer demand.

To develop a linear optimization model, we first define

the decision variables as the amount to ship between   
each plant and distribution center. In this model, we use

double-subscripted variables

to simplify the formulation.

Define

ij

i

to distribution

center

j

, where

i

=

1 represents Marietta,

i

[the unit-cost data in Table 13.4, the total cost of shipping](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#529)is equal to the unit cost multiplied by the amount shipped,   
summed over all combinations of plants and distribution   
centers. Therefore, the objective function is to minimize   
total cost:

The SUMPRODUCT function can be used for any two arrays as long as the dimensions are   
the same. Here, the function multiplies pairwise the cost coefficients in the range B6:E7 by   
the amounts shipped in the range B13:E14 and then adds the terms. In the model, we also   
use the SUM function in cells F13 and F14 to sum the amount shipped from each plant,   
and also in cells B15 to E15 to sum the total amount shipped to each distribution center.

Many linear optimization problems involve making decisions over a future time horizon.   
One example is planning production. The basic decision is how much to produce in each   
time period to meet anticipated demand over each period. Although it might seem obvi-  
ous to simply produce to the anticipated level of sales, it may be advantageous to produce   
more than needed in earlier time periods when production costs may be lower and store the   
excess production as inventory for use in later time periods, thereby letting lower produc-  
tion costs offset the costs of holding the inventory. So the best decision is often not obvious.

for the next year are 150 in the autumn, 400 in the winter,   
and 50 in the spring. Plain jewelry boxes are purchased   
from a supplier for $20. The cost of capital is estimated to   
be 24% per year (or 6% per quarter); thus, the holding cost   
per item is 0.06

1.20 per quarter. The company

hires art students part-time to craft designs during the   
autumn, and they earn $5.50 per hour. Because of the high   
demand for part-time help during the winter holiday season,   
labor rates are higher in the winter, and workers earn $7.00

per hour. In the spring, labor is more difficult to keep, and   
the owner must pay $6.25 per hour to retain qualified help.   
Each jewelry box takes two hours to complete. How should   
production be planned over the three quarters to minimize   
the combined production and inventory-holding costs?

The principal decision variables are the number of

jewelry boxes to produce during each of the three quarters.   
However, since we have the option of carrying inventory to   
other time periods, we must also define decision variables   
for the number of units to hold in inventory at the end of   
each quarter. The decision variables are

is to minimize the total cost of production and inventory.

The only explicit constraint is that demand must be

satisfied. Note that both the production in a quarter as well   
as the inventory held from the

previous

time quarter can be

used to satisfy demand. In addition, any amount in excess   
of the demand is held to the next quarter. Therefore, the   
constraints take the form of

inventory balance equations

that essentially say what is available in any time period   
must be accounted for somewhere. More formally,

Production

Inventory from the Previous Quarter

=

Demand

This can be represented visually using the diagram in

[Figure 13.29. For each quarter, the sum of the variables](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#531)coming in must equal the sum of the variables going out.   
Drawing such a figure is very useful for any type of multiple

Alternative Models

As we have seen, developing models is more of an art than a science; consequently, there   
is often more than one way to model a particular problem. Sometimes, alternative models   
are easier to understand or provide more useful information to the user. Using the ideas   
presented in the K\&L Designs example, we may construct an alternative model involving   
only the production variables.

EXAMPLE 13.20

An Alternative Optimization Model for K\&L Designs

In the

K\&L Designs

problem, we simply have to ensure that

demand is satisfied. We can do this by guaranteeing that   
the cumulative production in each quarter is at least as   
great as the cumulative demand. This is expressed by the   
following constraints:

The differences between the left- and right-hand sides of   
these constraints are the ending inventories for each period   
(and we need to keep track of these amounts because

inventory has a cost associated with it). Thus, we use the   
following objective function:

Of course, this function can be simplified algebraically by   
combining like terms. Although these two models look very   
different, they are mathematically equivalent and will pro-  
duce the same solution.

D. A. Branch \& Sons

The financial manager at D. A. Branch \& Sons must ensure   
that funds are available to pay company expenditures in the   
future but would also like to maximize investment income.   
Three short-term investment options are available over   
the next six months:

A

, a one-month CD that pays 0.25%

at maturity each month, and is available each month;

B

, a

three-month CD that pays 1.00% (at maturity), available at   
the beginning of the first four months; and

C

, a six-month

CD that pays 2.3% (at maturity), available in the first month.   
The net expenditures for the next six months are forecast   
as $50,000, ($12,000), $23,000, ($20,000), $41,000, and   
($13,000). Amounts in parentheses indicate a net inflow   
of cash. The company must maintain a cash balance of   
at least $10,000 at the end of each month. The company   
currently has $200,000 in cash.

At the beginning of each month, the manager must

decide how much to invest in each alternative that may be   
available. Define the following:

A

i

=

amount (

$

) to invest in a one

@

month CD at the start

C

) to invest in a six

Because the time horizons on these alternatives vary, it is   
helpful to draw a picture to represent the investments and   
[returns for each year, as shown in Figure 13.34. Each circle](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#535)represents the beginning of a month. Arrows represent the

somewhat complicated; however, it has similar characteristics of a typical financial spread-  
sheet. The key to constructing the

the monthly balance based on the amount of cash available (previous balance plus any   
investment returns), the net expenditures (remember that a negative expenditure is a cash   
inflow), and the amount invested as reflected by the decision variables. These balances are   
a practical interpretation of the constraint functions for each month in the model. In the

*Solver*

model, these balances simply need to be greater than or equal to the $10,000 cash-

balance requirement for each month.

Based on Sheldon D. Balbirer and David Shaw, "An Application of Linear Programming to Bank

Financial Planning,"

*Interfaces,*

11, 5 (October 1981).

One of the first applications of linear optimization in   
banking was developed by Central Carolina Bank and   
Trust Company (CCB). The bank's management became   
increasingly concerned with coordinating the activities of   
the bank to maximize interest rate differentials between   
sources and uses of funds. To address these concerns,   
the bank established a financial planning committee   
comprising all senior bank officers. The committee was   
charged with the responsibility of integrating the follow-  
ing functions: (1) interest rate forecasting, (2) forecast-  
ing demand for bank services, (3) liquidity management   
policy, and (4) funds allocation. At the same time, CCB's   
executive committee authorized the development of a bal-  
ance sheet optimization model using linear programming.

The initial stage in the model's development involved

a series of meetings with the financial planning committee   
to determine how complex the model needed to be. After   
a thorough discussion of the available options, the group   
settled on a one-year, single-period model, containing 66   
asset and 32 liability and equity categories. Even though   
a single-period planning model ignores many impor-  
tant time-related linkages, it was felt that a single-period   
framework would result in a model structure whose output   
could be readily internalized by management. An integral

part of these discussions involved an attempt to assure   
senior managers that the resulting model would capture their   
perceptions of the banking environment.

Next, the model was formulated and its data require-

ments were clearly identified. The major data inputs needed   
to implement the model were

■

■

expected yields on all securities and loan categories,

■

■

expected interest rates on deposits and money market   
liabilities,

■

■

administrative and/or processing costs on major loan and   
deposit categories,

■

■

expected loan losses, by loan type, as a percentage of   
outstanding loans,

■

■

maturity structure of all asset and liability categories,

■

■

forecasts of demand for bank services.

The bank's financial records served as a useful database   
for the required inputs. In those instances where meaningful   
data did not exist, studies were initiated to fill the gaps.

The decision variables in the model represented different

asset categories, such as cash, treasury securities, consumer   
loans, and commercial loans, among others; other variables   
represented liabilities and equities such as savings accounts,   
money market certificates, and certificates of deposit. The

objective function was to maximize profits, equaling the dif-  
ference between net yields and costs. Constraints reflected   
various operational, legal, and policy considerations, includ-  
ing bounds on various asset or liability categories that repre-  
sent forecasts of demand for bank services; minimum values   
of turnover for assets and liabilities; policy constraints that   
influence the allocation of funds among earning assets or the   
mix of funds used to finance assets; legal and regulatory con-  
straints; and constraints that prevent the allocation of short-  
term sources of funds to long-term uses, which gave the   
model a multiperiod dimension by considering the fund flow   
characteristics of the target balance sheet beyond the imme-  
diate planning horizon. Using the model, CCB successfully   
structured its assets and liabilities to better determine the   
bank's future position under different sets of assumptions.

tional time for finishing and polishing. Standard   
desks require 70 board feet of pine and 10 hours of   
labor, whereas deluxe desks require 50 board feet of   
pine, 20 square feet of oak, and 18 hours of labor.   
For the next week, the company has 5,000 board feet   
of pine, 750 square feet of oak, and 400 hours of   
labor available. Standard desks net a profit of $250,   
and deluxe desks net a profit of $350. All desks can   
be sold to national chains such as Staples or Office

Bangs Leisure Chairs produces three types of hand-  
crafted outdoor chairs that are popular for beach,   
pool, and patios: sling chairs, Adirondack chairs,   
and hammocks. The unit profit for these products   
is $40, $100, and $90, respectively. Each type of   
chair requires cutting, assembling, and finishing.   
The owner is retired and is willing to work six hours/  
day for five days/week, so has 120 hours available   
each month. He does not want to spend more than   
50 hours each month on any one activity (that is,   
cutting, assembling, and finishing). The retailer he   
works with is certain that all products he makes   
can easily be sold. Sling chairs are made up of ten   
wood pieces for the frame and one piece of cloth.   
The actual cutting of the wood takes 30 minutes.   
Assembling includes sewing of the fabric and the   
attachment of rivets, screws, fabric, and dowel rods,   
and takes 45 minutes. The finishing stage involves   
sanding, staining, and varnishing of the various parts   
and takes one hour. Adirondack chairs take two   
hours for both the cutting and assembling phases,

and finishing takes one hour. For hammocks, cutting   
takes 0.4 hour; assembly takes three hours; and fin-  
ishing also takes one hour. How many of each type   
of chair should he produce each month to maximize   
profit?

Malloy Milling grinds calcined alumina to a standard   
granular size. The mill produces two different size   
products from the same raw material. Regular grind   
can be produced at a rate of 10,000 pounds per hour   
and has a demand of 400 tons per week with a price   
per ton of $900. Super grind can be produced at a rate   
of 6,000 pounds per hour and has demand of 200 tons   
per week with a price of $1,900 per ton. A minimum   
of 700 tons has to be ground every week to make   
room in the raw material storage bins for previously   
purchased incoming raw material by rail. The mill   
operates 24/7 for a total of 168 hours/week.

Rosenberg Land Development (RLD) is a developer   
of condominium properties in the Southwest United   
States. RLD has recently acquired a 40.625-acre site   
outside Phoenix, Arizona. Zoning restrictions allow   
at most eight units per acre. Three types of condo-  
miniums are planned: one-, two-, and three-bedroom   
units. The average construction costs for each type of   
unit are $450,000, $600,000, and $750,000, respec-  
tively. These units will generate a net profit of 10%.   
The company has equity and loans totaling $180 mil-  
lion dollars for this project. From prior development   
projects, senior managers have determined that there   
must be a minimum of 15% one-bedroom units, 25%   
two-bedroom units, and 25% three-bedroom units.

performs in two venues: Kristin Marie Hall and the   
Lauren Elizabeth Theater. For the upcoming sea-  
son, seven shows have been chosen. The question

Shannon faces is how many performances of each   
of the seven shows should be scheduled. A finan-  
cial analysis has estimated revenues for each per-  
formance of the seven shows, and Shannon has   
set the minimum number of performances of each   
show based on union agreements with the Actor's   
Equity Association and the popularity of the shows   
in other markets. These data are shown in the table

The company has gathered $20 million to invest in   
floor stock. The risk column is a measure of risk asso-  
ciated with investment in floor stock based on past data   
from other stores and accounts for outdated inventory,   
pilferage, breakage, and so on. For instance, electronics   
loses 24% of its total investment, furniture loses 12%   
of its total investment, and so on. The amount of risk   
should be no more than 10% of the total investment.

Sanford Tile Company makes ceramic and porcelain   
tile for residential and commercial use. They produce   
three different grades of tile (for walls, residential   
flooring, and commercial flooring), each of which   
requires different amounts of materials and produc-  
tion time and generates different contributions to   
profit. The following information shows the percent-

6,000 pounds of clay, 3,000 pounds of silica, 5,000   
pounds of sand, and 8,000 pounds of feldspar.   
Because demand varies for the different grades,   
marketing estimates that at most 8,000 square feet   
of grade III tile should be produced and that at least   
1,500 square feet of grade I tiles are required. Each   
square foot of tile weighs approximately 2 pounds.

An international graduate student will receive a   
$28,000 foundation scholarship and reduced tuition.   
She must pay $1,500 in tuition for each of the   
autumn, winter, and spring quarters and $500 in the   
summer. Payments are due on the first day of Septem-  
ber, December, March, and May, respectively. Living   
expenses are estimated to be $1,500 per month, pay-  
able on the first day of the month. The foundation   
will pay her $18,000 on August 1 and the remain-  
der on May 1. To earn as much interest as possible,   
the student wishes to invest the money. Three types   
of investments are available at her bank: a three-  
month CD, earning 0.75% at maturity; a six-month   
CD, earning 1.9% at maturity; and a 12-month CD,   
earning 4.2% at maturity. Develop a linear optimiza-

Michelle is a business student who plans to attend   
medical school. The average state university medical   
school costs around $35,000 per year, and that cost   
is escalating rapidly. Michelle created a spreadsheet   
model to calculate the total expenses for each year of   
medical school, including both education and living   
expenses. Her estimates are year 1: $57,067, year 2:   
$56,572, year 3: $67,846, and year 4: $55,662. She   
is considering three loan options: the Stafford loan, a   
6.8% loan with a cap of $47,167 that does not accrue   
interest during medical school; the Graduate Plus   
loan, a 7.9% loan with no cap that does accrue inter-  
est during medical school; and a private bank loan, a   
5.9% loan with a cap of $30,000, also with accruing   
interest during medical school. Assume that each loan   
will be paid over 25 years after graduation. Michelle   
currently has $39,500 saved from investments, family   
gifts, and work, and will receive an additional $4,500   
in gifts from her grandparents in years 2 through 4.   
Develop and solve an optimization model to deter-  
mine how much money to fund from each type of   
loan to minimize the amount of interest that will have   
to be paid on the loans. (Hint: Use the Excel func-  
tion CUMIPMT to find the total interest that will be   
paid over the life of a loan. For example, if a 30-year   
loan for $100,000 has an interest rate of 9%, then the   
formula

=

-

CUMIPMT(9%, 30, 100,000, 1, 30, 0)

will yield $192,009 cumulative interest paid between   
years 1 and 30. (Note that this function yields a nega-  
tive value, so include the minus sign.)

steel. In addition to fabrication, the parts must be put   
through an acid bath to show any deformities during   
quality inspection. Compressor blades use 8 lb of alu-  
minum, 2 lb of titanium, and 15 lb of acid and have   
a profit contribution of $3,000. Sheaths require 3 lb   
of steel and 5 lb of acid and yield $1,500 in profit.   
Finally, the turbine blades require 6 lb of aluminum,   
1.5 lb of titanium, and 10 lb of acid and yield a profit   
of $2,000. Warehouse storage is limited, and it can   
handle a maximum of 14,000 lb of aluminum, 7,000

lb of titanium, 6,000 lb of steel, and 25,000 lb of acid.   
In the next planning period, orders call for 1,500   
compressor blades, 1,500 sheaths, and 2,000 turbine   
blades; thus, at least this many of each must be pro-  
duced. Note that compressor blades and sheaths are   
used together, and the company must produce an   
equal number of these parts. Formulate and solve a   
linear optimization model. You will discover that the   
solution is infeasible. Determine what must be done   
in order to obtain a feasible solution.

Elizabeth Burke wants to develop a model to more effec-  
tively plan production for the next year. Currently, PLE   
has a planned capacity of producing 9,100 mowers each   
month, which is approximately the average monthly   
demand over the previous year. However, looking at the   
unit sales figures for the previous year, she observed that   
the demand for mowers has a seasonal fluctuation, so with   
this "level" production strategy, there is overproduction in   
some months, resulting in excess inventory buildup, and   
underproduction in others, which may result in lost sales   
during peak demand periods.

Ms. Burke explained that she could change the pro-

duction rate by using planned overtime or undertime (pro-  
ducing more or less than the average monthly demand),   
but this incurs additional costs, although it may offset the   
cost of lost sales or of maintaining excess inventory. Con-  
sequently, she believes that the company can save a signif-  
icant amount of money by optimizing the production plan.

Ms. Burke saw a presentation at a conference about a

similar model that another company used but didn't fully   
understand the approach. The PowerPoint notes didn't   
have all the details, but they did explain the variables and   
the types of constraints used in the model. She thought   
they would be helpful to you in implementing an optimiza-  
tion model. Here are the highlights from the presentation:

Ms. Burke also provided the following data

and estimates for the next year: unit production   
cost

=

$70.00; inventory-holding cost

=

$1.40 per unit

per month; lost sales cost

=

$200 per unit; overtime

cost

=

$6.50 per unit; undertime cost

=

$3.00 per unit;

and production-rate-change cost

=

$5.00 per unit, which

applies to any increase or decrease in the production rate   
from the previous month. Initially, 900 units are expected   
to be in inventory at the beginning of January, and the pro-  
duction rate for the past December was 9,100 units. She   
believes that monthly demand will not change substan-  
tially from last year, so the mower unit sales figures for the   
last year in the

*Performance Lawn Equipment Database*

should be used for the monthly demand forecasts.

Your task is to design a spreadsheet that provides

detailed information on monthly production, inventory,   
lost sales, and the different cost categories and solve a   
linear optimization model for minimizing the total cost   
of meeting demand over the next year. Compare your   
solution with the level production strategy of producing   
9,100 units each month. Interpret the Sensitivity Report   
and conduct an appropriate study of how the solution will   
be affected by changing the assumption of the lost sales   
costs. Summarize all your results in a report to Ms. Burke.

Chapter 14

Integer and Nonlinear Optimization

In the previous chapter, we saw that the variables in linear optimization models

can assume any real value. For many practical applications, we need not be con-

cerned with this assumption. For example, in deciding on the optimal number

of cases of diapers to produce next month, we could use a linear model, since

rounding a value like 5,621.63 would have little impact on the results. However,

in a production-planning decision involving low-volume, high-cost items such as

airplanes, an optimal value of 10.42 would make little sense, and a difference of

one unit (rounded up or down) could have significant economic and production

planning consequences. In this situation, we would need to ensure that the solu-

tion is integer-valued. Similarly, linear functions may not be appropriate for mod-

eling some objective functions or constraints, so we would need to use nonlinear

functions to better reflect the problem. Building nonlinear optimization models

requires more creativity and analytical expertise than linear or integer models.

In this chapter, we discuss how to build and solve integer and nonlinear opti-

mization models and illustrate applications in a variety of practical problems.

These types of models provide a lot of flexibility to handle many more realistic

and difficult situations than do simple linear optimization models. For example,

airlines use integer optimization to schedule crews and airline flight segments,

and investment firms use nonlinear optimization to create client portfolios.

[Integer Linear Optimization Models](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#15)

**Integer linear optimization models**

are simply linear models with added constraints on

variables to ensure that they are integer-valued (that is, whole numbers). Decision vari-  
ables that we force to be integers are called

**general integer variables**

. We may model any

variable in an ordinary linear program to be a general integer variable simply by specifying   
it as an integer. For example, if in the Sklenka Ski Company (SSC) model (see [Chapter 13)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494)we wish to restrict the number of pairs of skis produced to be whole numbers, we would   
add the following constraints:

Jordanelle

=

integer

Deercrest

=

integer

Many optimization models require

**binary variables**

, which are variables that are restricted

to being either 0 or 1. Mathematically, a binary variable

*x*

is simply a general integer vari-

able that is restricted to being between 0 and 1:

0

...

*x*

...

1 and integer

**(14.1)**

However, we usually just write this as

*x*

=

0 or 1. Binary variables enable us to model

logical decisions in optimization problems. For example, binary variables can be used   
to model decisions such as whether or not to place a facility at a certain location, whether   
or not to run a production line, or whether or not to invest in a certain stock. For example,   
we could set

*x*

=

1 if we place a facility at the location, and

*x*

=

0 if we don't. Similarly,

if we run the production line, we would set

*x*

=

1; if not, we would set

*x*

=

0.

Chapter 14

Integer and Nonlinear Optimization

525

Finally, any practical applications of optimization involve a combination of continu-

ous variables, general integer variables, and/or binary variables. This provides the flexibil-  
ity to model many different types of complex decision problems. However, in this book we   
will keep things simple and not address these types of models.

[Models with General Integer Variables](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#15)

If we solve the linear optimization model without the integer restrictions (called the

**linear**

**program \[LP\] relaxation**

) and the optimal solution happens to have all integer values,

then it clearly would have solved the integer model. This is generally not the case, how-  
ever. The algorithm used to solve integer optimization models begins by solving the LP   
relaxation and proceeds to enforce the integer restrictions using a systematic search pro-  
cess that involves solving a series of modified linear optimization problems. You need not   
worry about understanding how this is accomplished, because

*Solver*

takes care of the

algorithmic details.

When using

*Solver*

, it is important to set a parameter called

*Integer Tolerance*

. This

value specifies when the

*Solver*

algorithm will terminate. By default,

*Integer Tolerance*

is

set to 0.05 within

*Solver*

. This means that

*Solver*

will stop if it finds an integer solution that

is within 5% of the optimal solution. With this value, you may end up with a solution that   
is not the optimum, but is 95% of the way there. It does this for computational efficiency   
because many practical problems take a very long time to solve, even with today's technol-  
ogy (hours or even days!). If an answer is needed quickly, a manager might be satisfied   
with a near-optimal solution that is guaranteed to be within a fixed percentage of the best.   
To find the guaranteed optimal integer solution,

*Integer Tolerance*

must be set to 0. To do

this, click the

*Options*

button in the

*Solver Parameters*

dialog and ensure that the value of

*Integer Optimality (%)*

is 0.

We saw that the optimal solution was to produce 5.25 pairs   
of Jordanelle skis and 10.5 pairs of Deercrest skis. Because   
the solution involves fractions, it would be beneficial to   
find the optimal solution for which the decision variables   
are integers. To do this, we simply add the constraints that   
Deercrest and Jordanelle must be integers to the model.   
[Figure 14.1 shows the graphical illustration of the set of](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#555)

feasible values (dark blue dots) that satisfy all constraints as   
well as the integer restrictions.

[as shown in Figure 14.2. We also need to ensure that we](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#555)set the

Integer Tolerance

parameter to zero as discussed

[earlier. Figure 14.3 shows the resulting solution. Notice](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#555)that the maximum value of the objective function for the   
model with integer restrictions is smaller than the linear   
optimization solution. This is expected because we have   
added an additional constraint (the integer restrictions).   
Whenever you add a constraint to a model, the value of the   
objective function can never improve and usually worsens.   
[Figure 14.4 illustrates this graphically. As the profit line](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#556)increases, the last feasible integer point through which   
it passes is (3, 12). Notice also that the optimal integer   
solution is not the same as the solution you would obtain   
from rounding the optimal solution to the LP relaxation.

If Sklenka Ski Company were a real company, they would be producing thousands of

pairs of skis for the world market. As we noted, it probably would not make much differ-  
ence if they simply rounded the optimal solution to the linear optimization model. In other   
types of models, however, it is critical to enforce solution to the integer restrictions. For   
example, the paper industry needs to find the best mix of cutting patterns to meet demand   
for various sizes of paper rolls. In a similar fashion, sheet steel producers cut strips of dif-  
ferent sizes from rolled coils of thin steel. For these types of problems, fractional values   
for the decision variables make no sense at all. Finding the best solution for such prob-  
lems requires integer optimization. Here is one example.

EXAMPLE 14.2

A Cutting-Stock Problem

Suppose that a company makes standard 110-inch-wide   
rolls of thin sheet metal and slits them into smaller rolls   
to meet customer orders for widths of 12, 15, and 30   
inches. The demands for these widths vary from week   
to week.

From a 110-inch roll, there are many different ways

to slit 12-, 15-, and 30-inch pieces. A

cutting pattern

is a

configuration of the number of smaller rolls of each type   
that are cut from the raw stock. Of course, we would want   
to use as much of the roll as possible to avoid costly scrap.   
For example, we could cut seven 15-inch rolls, leaving   
a 5-inch piece of scrap, or cut three 30-inch rolls and   
one 12-inch roll, leaving 8 inches of scrap. Finding good   
cutting patterns for a large set of end products is, in itself,   
a challenging problem. Suppose that the company has   
proposed the following cutting patterns:

Demands for the coming week are 500 12-inch rolls, 715   
15-inch rolls, and 630 30-inch rolls. The problem is to   
develop a model that will determine how many 110-inch   
rolls to cut into each of the six patterns to meet demand   
and minimize scrap.

) with the optimal solution. The constraint functions for the num-

functions of the decision variables in B15:B20 and the data in rows 5 through 10. The

model is sho[wn in Figure 14.6.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#558)

Workforce scheduling is a practical yet highly complex problem that many businesses   
face. Many fast-food operations hire students who can work in only small chunks of time   
during the week, resulting in a huge number of possible schedules. In such operations,   
customer demand varies by day of week and time of day, further complicating the problem   
of assigning workers to time slots. Similar problems exist in scheduling nurses in hospitals,   
flight crews in airlines, and many other service operations.

Brewer Services

Brewer Services contracts with outsourcing partners to   
handle various customer-service functions. The customer-  
service department is open Monday through Friday from 8   
a.m. to 5 p.m. Calls vary over the course of a typical day.   
Based on a study of call volumes provided by one of the   
firm's partners, the minimum number of staff needed each   
hour of the day are as follows:

Mr. Brewer wants to hire some permanent employees

and staff the remaining requirements using part-time   
employees who work four-hour shifts (four consecutive hours   
starting as early as 8 a.m. or as late as 1 p.m.). Suppose   
that Mr. Brewer has five permanent employees. What is the   
minimum number of part-time employees he will need for each   
four-hour shift to ensure meeting the staffing requirements?

Assuming that the five permanent employees work

the full day, the part-time coverage requirements can be   
calculated by subtracting 5 from the minimum staff required

for each of the time slots in the table. Define

X

i

to be the

number of part-time employees who will work a four-hour   
shift beginning at hour

i

, where

i

=

1 corresponds to an

8:00 a.m. start,

i

=

2 corresponds to a 9:00 a.m. start, and

so on, with

last part-time shift. The objective is to minimize the total

In looking at the solution, a manager might not be satisfied with the distribution of work-  
ers, particularly the fact that there are seven excess employees during the first hour. In most   
scheduling problems, many alternative optimal solutions usually exist. A little creativity in   
using the optimization model can help identify these.

EXAMPLE 14.4

Finding Alternative Optimal Solutions for

Brewer Services

Model

An easy way to find an alternative optimal solution that   
reduces the number of excess employees at 8:00 a.m. is to   
define a constraint setting the objective function equal to   
its optimal value and then changing the objective function   
in the model to minimize the number of excess employees   
[during the first hour. Figure 14.9 shows the modified](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#561)

and the new objective function to minimize the excess   
number of employees at 8:00 a.m., the value in cell E21.   
The solution is shown in[Figure 14.10](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#561). In a "whack-a-mole"

fashion, we now have nine excess employees during the noon   
hour, a solution which isn't any better than the original one.

A better approach would be to define additional

constraints to restrict the excess number of employees   
in the range E21:E29 to be less than or equal to some   
maximum number

k

and then attempt to minimize the

original objective function. This

Binary variables provide an incredible amount of flexibility in optimization modeling.   
One common example we present next is project selection, in which a subset of potential

EXAMPLE 14.5

Hahn Engineering

Hahn Engineering's research and development group has   
identified five potential new engineering and development   
projects; however, the firm is constrained by its available   
budget and human resources. Each project is expected to   
generate a return (given by the net present value \[NPV\]) but   
requires a fixed amount of cash and personnel. Because   
the resources are limited, all projects cannot be selected.   
Projects cannot be partially completed; thus, either the   
project must be undertaken completely or not at all. The   
[data are given in Table 14.1. If a project is selected, it](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#563)generates the full value of the expected return and requires   
[the full amount of cash and personnel shown in Table 14.1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#563)For example, if we select projects 1 and 3, the total return   
is $180,000

$150,000

$330,000, and these projects

require cash totaling $55,000

$24,000

and 5

To model this situation, we define the decision

variables to be binary, corresponding to either not selecting   
or selecting each project, respectively. Define

x

i

=

1 if

project

i

is selected and 0 if it is not selected. By multiplying

these binary variables by the expected returns, the   
objective function is

file

*Hahn Engineering Project Selection*

). The decision variables are defined in cells

B11:F11. By multiplying these values by the data for each project in rows 5--7, we can   
easily compute the total return, cash used, and personnel used for the projects that are   
selected in rows 12--14. The objective function is computed in cell G12 as the sum of   
the returns for the selected projects. Similarly, the amounts of cash and personnel used   
are also summed for the projects selected, representing the constraint functions in cells   
G13 and G14. The optimal solution is to select projects 1, 3, and 5 for a total return of   
$530,000.

Binary variables allow us to model a wide variety of logical constraints. For example, sup-  
pose that if project 1 is selected, then project 4 must also be selected. Your first thought   
might be to incorporate an IF function in the Excel model. However, recall that we noted in   
[Chapter 13 that such functions destro](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494)y the linearity property of the Excel model; therefore,   
we need to express such constraints differently. If project 1 is selected, then

*x*

1

=

1, and

we want to force

*x*

4

to be 1 also. This can be done using the following constraint:

*x*

4

Ú

*x*

1

Mathematically, if

*x*

1

=

1, then this constraint implies that

*x*

4

Ú

1 and, consequently,

*x*

4

must equal 1. If

*x*

Suppose that a company has numerous potential locations for distribution centers that

will ship products to many customers and wants to redesign its supply chain by selecting a   
fixed number of distribution centers. In an effort to provide exceptional customer service,   
some companies have a single-sourcing policy---that is, every customer can be supplied   
from only one distribution center. The problem is to determine how to assign customers to   
the distribution centers so as to minimize the total cost of shipping to the customers.

Define

*j*

is assigned to distribution center

*i*

and 0 if it is not;

*Y*

is chosen from among a set of potential locations and 0 if it is not

chosen; and

*j*

from distribution

center

*i*

. We wish to minimize the total cost, ensure that every customer is assigned to one

and only one distribution center, and select

distribution centers from the set of potential

locations. This can be accomplished by the following model:

A

**nonlinear optimization model**

is one in which the objective function and/or at least

one constraint is nonlinear. Nonlinear models are generally more difficult to develop than   
linear models simply because the objective function and constraint functions may not have   
the familiar linear structure. Thus, building nonlinear optimization models relies on fun-  
damental modeling principles that we introduced in[Chapter 11.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406) For example, we may   
use business logic to identify the appropriate functional relationships among the decision   
variables or empirical data and line-fitting techniques to characterize the nonlinearities. In   
addition, nonlinear optimization models are considerably more difficult to solve than either   
linear or integer models. However,

*Solver*

provides solution procedures that can solve non-

linear optimization problems quite effectively.

A principal component of SGE was the North

North American supply chain consisted of hundreds of sup-  
pliers, more than 50 product categories, more than 60 plants,   
15 distribution centers, and more than 1,000 customers. The   
need to consolidate plants was driven by the move to global   
brands and common packaging and the need to reduce man-  
ufacturing expense, improve speed to market, avoid major   
capital investments, and deliver better consumer value.

P\&G had a policy of single sourcing; therefore, one of

the key submodels in the overall optimization effort was the   
customer assignment optimization model described in this   
section to identify optimal distribution center locations in the   
supply chain and to assign customers to the distribution cen-  
ters. Customers were aggregated into 150 zones. The param-  
eter

k

was varied by the analysis team to examine the effects

of choosing different numbers of locations. This model was   
used in conjunction with a simple transportation model for   
each of 30 product categories. Product-strategy teams used   
these models to specify plant locations and capacity options   
and optimize the flow of product from plants to distribution   
centers and customers. In reconfiguring the supply chain,   
P\&G realized annual cost savings of more than $250 million.

EXAMPLE 14.9

A Hotel Pricing Model

The Marquis Hotel is considering a major remodeling effort   
and needs to determine the best rates and room sizes to   
maximize revenues. Currently, the hotel has 450 rooms with   
the following history:

Total Revenue

$38,000

Each market segment has its own price/demand elasticity.   
Estimates are as follows:

Room Type

Price Elasticity of Demand

Standard

-

1.5

Gold

-

2.0

Platinum

-

1.0

This means, for example, that a 1%

decrease

in

the price of a standard room will

increase

the number of

rooms sold by 1.5%. Similarly, a 1% increase in the price   
will decrease the number of rooms sold by 1.5%. For any   
pricing structure (in $), the projected number of rooms   
of a given type sold (we allow continuous values for this   
example) can be found using the formula

Historical Average Number of Rooms Sold

+

\[(Elasticity)

\*

(New Price

-

Current Price)

\*

(Historical Average Number of Rooms Sold)\]

Current Price

The hotel owners want to keep the price of a stan-

dard room between $70 and $90, a gold room between   
$90 and $110, and a platinum room between $120 and   
$149. Define

S

=

price of a standard room,

price

of a gold room, and

. The

objective is to set the room prices to maximize total rev-  
enue. Total revenue will equal the price multiplied by the   
projected number of rooms sold, summed over all three   
types of rooms. Therefore, total revenue will be

A special class of nonlinear optimization models is known as a quadratic

optimization

model,

sometimes called a quadratic programming model. A

**quadratic optimization model**

is one

that has a quadratic objective and all linear constraints. Recall from algebra that a quadratic   
function is

*f*

(

*x*

)

=

*ax*

2

+

*bx*

+

*c*

. In other words, a quadratic function has only constant,

linear, and squared terms. Quadratic optimization models can be solved using the

*Standard*

*LP/Quadratic*

solving method within

*Solver*

.

The

**Markowitz portfolio model**

is a classic quadratic optimization model in finance

that seeks to minimize the risk of a portfolio of stocks subject to a constraint on the portfo-  
lio's expected return.

2

The decision variables are the percent of each stock to allocate to the

portfolio. (You might be familiar with the term

*asset allocation model*

that many financial

investment companies suggest to their clients---for example, "maintain 60% equities, 30%   
bonds, and 10% cash.") Recall [from Chapter 4](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#144)that we can measure risk by the standard   
deviation, or, equivalently, the variance. In the Markowitz model, the objective function is   
to minimize the risk of the portfolio as measured by its variance. Because stock prices are   
correlated with one another, the variance of the portfolio must reflect not only variances of   
the stocks in the portfolio but also the covariance between stocks.

Define

*x*

*j*

to be the fraction of the portfolio to invest in stock

*j*

. The variance of a port-

folio consisting of

*k*

stocks is the weighted sum of the variances and covariances:

EXAMPLE 14.10

An Example of the Markowitz Model

Suppose an investor is considering three stocks in which to   
invest. The expected return for stock 1 is 10%, for stock 2,   
12%, and for stock 3, 7%, and she would like an expected   
return of at least 10%. Clearly one option is to invest everything   
in stock 1; however, this may not be a good idea because   
the risk might be too high. Research has found the variance-  
covariance matrix of the individual stocks to be the following:

Stock 1

Many nonlinear problems are notoriously difficult to solve.

*Solver*

cannot guarantee that

it will find the absolute best solution (called a global optimal solution) for all problems.   
A

**local optimum solution**

is one for which all points close by are no better than the solu-

tion (an analogy is being at the top of a mountain when the highest peak is on another   
mountain). The solution found often depends a great deal on the starting solution in your   
spreadsheet. For complex problems, it is wise to run

*Solver*

from different starting points.

You should also look carefully at the

*Solver*

results dialog box when the model has com-

pleted running. If it indicates "Solver has found a solution. All constraints and optimality   
conditions are satisfied," then at least a local optimal solution has been found. If you get   
the message "Solver has converged to the current solution. All constraints are satisfied,"   
then you should run

*Solver*

again from the current solution to try to find a better solution.

Portfolio Model

Prudential Securities Inc. (PSI) created a mortgage-  
backed securities (MBS) department to develop mod-  
els for managing complex investments. The department   
developed a variety of analytical models, including lin-  
ear, integer, and nonlinear optimization models, to help   
value, trade, and hedge MBS in inventory and construct   
portfolios. In one example, nonlinear optimization mod-  
els are used to construct optimal portfolios for clients,   
matching the clients' investment performance profile with   
constraints under a variety of interest rate scenarios. The   
model inputs required from the client include the portfo-  
lio performance target, the securities to consider, diver-  
sification restrictions, and view of future interest rates.

[ANALYTICS IN PRACTICE: Applying Nonlinear Optimization at Prudential Securities](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#15)

Analysts use a scenario analysis to generate an optimal   
portfolio composed of securities with widely differing char-  
acteristics that matches the investor's performance pro-  
file under a variety of interest rate scenarios and employs   
a weighting scheme on the scenarios to reflect the portfo-  
lio manager's actual view of the direction of future interest   
rates. The portfolio manager defines the desired portfolio   
performance for each scenario. An optimization technique   
bundles the different scenarios and leads to optimal struc-  
tured portfolios that meet specified performance targets   
while taking into account possible interest rate movement.   
These models have been used hundreds of times per day by   
PSI personnel.

Integer and Nonlinear Optimization

As we noted in [Chapter 13](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494), such Excel functions as IF, ABS, MIN, and MAX lead to

**non-smooth optimization models**

. Non-smooth models violate the linearity condi-

tions required for the linear optimization solution method used by

*Solver*

. Nevertheless,

using these Excel functions can simplify the modeling task, especially for nonanalytics   
professionals.

[Evolutionary Solver](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#15)

Problems that are non-smooth or involve both nonlinear functions and integer variables   
are usually difficult to solve using conventional techniques. To overcome these limita-  
tions, new approaches called

*metaheuristics*

have been developed by researchers. These

approaches have some exotic names, including genetic algorithms, neural networks, and   
tabu search. Such approaches use heuristics---intelligent rules for systematically searching   
among solutions---that remember the best solutions they find and then modify or combine   
them in attempting to find better solutions.

*Solver's Evolutionary*

algorithm uses such an

approach.

Many business problems involve fixed costs; they are either incurred in full or not at

all. We may use binary variables to model such situations; however, this approach can be   
difficult to understand, as it requires advanced optimization logic to incorporate the fixed   
costs correctly in the model constraints. However, from a spreadsheet modeling perspec-  
tive, it is quite easy to use IF functions to model fixed costs. This is acceptable when using   
the evolutionary algorithm.

EXAMPLE 14.11

Incorporating Fixed Costs into the K\&L Designs Model

Consider the multiperiod production-inventory-planning   
model for K\&L Designs that we developed in Example 13.19.   
Suppose that the company must rent some equipment,   
which costs $65 for three months. The equipment can be   
rented or returned each quarter, so if nothing is produced in   
a quarter, it makes no sense to incur the rental cost. Thus, if   
the production in any quarter is positive, we want to include   
the rental cost in the objective function; otherwise, we   
don't. We can do this by adding IF functions to the original   
objective function:

model. The

algorithm

requires that all variables have simple upper and lower

bounds to restrict the search space to a manageable   
region. Thus, we set upper bounds of 600 (the total   
demand) and lower bounds of 0 for each of them.

finds essentially the same optimal

solution as the integer optimization problem we solved   
[in Chapter 13, except for a minor rounding issue in](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494)cell C14.

Because

*Evolutionary Solver*

is a search procedure, it may get "stuck" on an inferior

or even an infeasible solution. We suggest that you run the method several times from the   
previous solution, until you receive a message that the current solution cannot be improved.

The results obtained by

*Evolutionary Solver*

can depend heavily on the starting values

of the decision variables and the amount of time devoted to the search. For simple prob-  
lems, it usually doesn't make much difference; however, for complex models, different   
starting values can produce different results. In addition, increasing the maximum search   
time may improve the solution. Thus, for complex problems, it is wise to run the procedure   
from different starting points, and we suggest you try this on this example and end-of-  
chapter problems. The maximum search time and other parameters can be changed from   
the

*Options*

button in the dialog; however, this is usually only necessary for advanced users.

Some applications use absolute value functions in the objective function or constraints.

Absolute value functions are similar to IF functions and result in non-smooth functions, neces-  
sitating the use of

*Evolutionary Solver*

. The following example draws upon the central facilities

location problem introduced in [Example 11.16 u](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)sing the rectilinear distance [formula (11.8).](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#432)

EXAMPLE 14.13

A Rectilinear Location Model

Edwards Manufacturing is studying where to locate a tool   
bin on the factory floor. The locations of five production   
cells are expressed as

x

- and

y

-coordinates on a

rectangular grid of the factory layout. The daily demand for   
tools (measured as the number of trips to the tool bin) at   
each production cell is also known. The relevant data are   
as follows:

Because of the nature of the equipment layout in the factory   
and for safety reasons, workers must travel along marked   
horizontal and vertical aisles to access the tool bin. Thus,   
the distance from a cell to the tool bin cannot be measured   
as a straight line; rather, it must be measured as

rectilinear

distance

---that is, the distances parallel to the axes of the

coordinate system. We may use the rectilinear distance

[measure in formula (11.8) to compute the distance between](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#432)locations. The optimal location should minimize the total   
weighted distance between the tool bin and all production   
cells, where the weights are the daily number of trips to the   
tool bin.

To formulate an optimization model for the best

location, define (

X

,

Y

) as the location coordinates of the tool

bin. The weighted distance between the tool bin and each   
cell is expressed by the objective function

The

**traveling salesperson problem (TSP)**

can be described as follows. A salesperson

needs to visit each of

*n*

different cities and return home in the minimum total distance. A

route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the start is called a

**tour**

. Many practi-

cal problems can be formulated as a TSP. For example, drivers for FedEx and UPS must   
deliver packages to customers and return to their central location. Soft-drink vendors must   
collect money and replenish bottles for a set of retail locations and then return to the ware-  
house. Other examples are programming drilling machines to drill holes in circuit boards   
and picking orders within a warehouse. In all these applications, the goal is to perform the   
task in minimum total time or distance.

In general, a TSP for

*n*

cities has (

*n*

-

1)! possible tours, making it quite difficult to

identify the optimal one. For example, if

*n*

is just 14, there are more than 6 billion possible

tours! The use of algorithms such as

*Evolutionary Solver*

allow us to find near-optimal

solutions efficiently.

EXAMPLE 14.15

Touring American League Cities

An avid baseball fan in Detroit would like to plan a trip to   
visit all 14 ballparks of baseball teams in the American   
League and minimize the total travel distance.[Figure 14.32](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#581)shows a spreadsheet model designed for

Evolutionary

Solver

(Excel file

American Baseball League

). The data

matrix shows the distances between each pair of cities. The   
model is somewhat tricky to develop and requires some   
detailed explanation to understand. We number the cities   
from 0 to 13 (this is necessary to use one of the capabilities   
of

Solver

, as we soon explain). Any city can be chosen as

the start because a feasible sequence requires that the fan   
visit each city exactly once and return to the starting point,   
so we arbitrarily choose city 0 as the start. The decision   
variables are in the range B23:B35; the tour shown in the   
figure sequences the cities in numerical order. Note that   
when we get to the (

n

-

1)st city, we must return to city

0, so cell B36 is not a decision variable. We set cell A23   
to 0. Whatever city is chosen to move to from city 0 is the   
decision variable in cell B23. We must ensure that this city   
becomes the "From" city in the next row; thus, the formula in   
cell A24 is

=

B23. In other words, we simply copy the value

of cell B23 into cell A24 and do this for the remaining cells   
in column A. The INDEX function is used to find the distance   
from one city to another (note that the INDEX function refers   
to the row and column numbers of the range $D$5:$Q$18

and not the numbering of the cities that we used). Finally, in   
columns E and F, we use the VLOOKUP function to translate   
the numerical city values in the tour to their names.

[Figure 14.33 shows the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#581)

Solver

model. The objective

is to minimize the total tour length in cell C37 by changing   
the decision variables in the range B23:B35. The key to   
using Solver's

Evolutionary

algorithm is to ensure that

the decision variables include each of the remaining 13   
cities visited in the tour from city 0 exactly once. This   
is accomplished by using the

alldifferent

constraint, as

we saw in the job-sequencing example. Because the

alldifferent

constraint applies to a set of positive integers

from 1 to

n

, we needed to designate the first city as 0

(otherwise, the decision variables would have had to range   
from 2 to 14, and we would not have been able to use the

alldifferent

constraint).

[Figure 14.34](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#582)shows the solution that

Evolutionary

Solver

finds. To find the tour starting in Detroit, begin at

row 34 and cycle around the tour to Milwaukee, Minnesota,   
Seattle, Oakland, California, Texas, Kansas City, Chicago,   
Cleveland, Baltimore, New York, Boston, Toronto, and return   
to Detroit, for a total distance of 6,718 miles. Of course, the   
real problem should incorporate the game schedules (who   
wants to visit a ballpark if the team is out of town?), but this   
would require a much more complicated model.

The Gardner Theater, a community playhouse, needs   
to determine the lowest-cost production budget for an   
upcoming show. Specifically, they have to determine   
which set pieces to construct and which, if any, set

pieces to rent from another local theater at a prede-  
termined fee. However, the organization has only two   
weeks to fully construct the set before the play goes   
into technical rehearsals. The theater has two part-  
time carpenters who work up to 12 hours a week,   
each at $10 an hour. Additionally, the theater has a   
part-time scenic artist who can work 15 hours per   
week to paint the set and props as needed at a rate of   
$15 per hour. The set design requires 20 flats (walls),   
two hanging drops with painted scenery, and three   
large wooden tables (props). The number of hours   
required for each piece for carpentry and painting is   
shown below:

and how many should be rented to minimize total   
costs?

Van Nostrand Hospital must schedule nurses so that   
the hospital's patients are provided with adequate   
care. At the same time, in the face of tighter com-  
petition in the health care industry, careful attention   
must be paid to keeping costs down. From histori-  
cal records, administrators can project the minimum   
number of nurses to have on hand for the various   
times of day and days of the week. The nurse-schedul-  
ing problem seeks to find the minimum total number   
of nurses required to provide adequate care. Nurses   
start work at the beginning of one of the four-hour   
shifts given next and work for eight hours. Formulate   
and solve the nurse-scheduling problem as an integer   
program for one day for the data shown next.

Joe is an active 26-year-old male who lifts weights six   
days a week. His rigorous training program requires   
a diet that will help his body recover efficiently. He   
is also a graduate student who is looking to minimize   
the cost of consuming his favorite foods. Joe is trying   
to gain weight, or at least maintain his current body   
weight, so he is not concerned about calories. His per-  
sonal trainer suggests at least 300 grams of protein,   
95 grams of fat, 225 grams of carbohydrates, and no   
more than 110 grams of sodium per day. His favorite   
foods are all items that he is familiar with preparing,   
as shown in the table

*Data for Problem 7*

. He is will-

ing to consume multiple servings of each food per day   
to meet his requirements, although he cannot eat more   
than one steak per day and does not want to eat more   
than three pulled pork sandwiches a day. He needs   
to consume at least two servings of broccoli and one   
serving of carrots per day but is willing to eat two serv-  
ings of carrots if necessary. Joe likes a certain brand   
of nutrition bars, but he would not eat more than one.   
Unless previously noted, he does not want more than   
five servings of any one food. How many servings of   
each food should he have in an optimal daily diet?

The Kelmer Performing Arts Center offers a series of   
four programs that includes jazz, bluegrass, folk, clas-  
sical, and comedy. The Program Coordinator needs to   
determine which acts to choose for next year's series.   
She assigned an "impact" rating to each artist that   
reflects how well the act meets the center's mission   
and provides community value. This rating is on a   
scale from 1 to 4, with 4 being the greatest impact and   
1 being the least impact. The theater has 500 seats with   
an average ticket price of $12. Based on an estimate of   
the potential sales, the revenue from each artist is cal-  
culated. The center has a budget of $20,000 and would   
like the total impact factor to be at least 12, reflect-  
ing an average impact per artist of at least 3. To avoid   
duplication of genres, at most one of artists 2, 7, and 9   
may be chosen, and at most one of artists 3 and 6 may   
be chosen. Finally, the center wishes to maximize its   
revenue. Data are shown below.

tional local demand for concerts and increasing ticket   
revenue and also gaining attention at the national level   
to build awareness of the ensemble across the coun-  
try. He has $20,000 to spend on media advertising.   
The goal of the advertising campaign is to generate   
as much local recognition as possible while reaching   
at least 3,000 units of national exposure. He has set a   
limit of 100 total ads. Additional information is shown

■

■

Making a demo CD

■

■

Hiring an agent

■

■

Handing out fliers

■

■

Tindall Gifts is a major national retail chain with stores   
located principally in shopping malls. For many years,   
the company published a Christmas catalog that was   
sent to current customers on file. This strategy gen-  
erated additional e-commerce business, while also   
attracting customers to the stores. However, the cost-  
effectiveness of this strategy was never determined.   
John Harris, vice president of marketing, conducted a   
major study on the effectiveness of Tindall's Christ-  
mas catalog. The results were favorable: Patrons who   
were catalog recipients spent more, on average, than   
did comparable non-recipients. These revenue gains   
more than compensated for the costs of production,   
handling, and mailing, which had been substantially   
reduced by cooperative allowances from suppliers.   
With the continuing interest in direct mail as a vehicle   
for delivering holiday catalogs, Harris continued to

investigate how new customers could most effectively   
be reached. One of these ideas involved purchas-  
ing mailing lists of magazine subscribers through a   
list broker. To determine which magazines might be   
appropriate, a mail questionnaire was administered   
to a sample of current customers to ascertain which   
magazines they regularly read. Ten magazines were   
selected for the survey. The assumption behind this   
strategy is that subscribers of magazines having a high   
proportion of current customers would be viable tar-  
gets for future purchases at Tindall stores. The ques-  
tion is which magazine lists should be purchased to   
maximize the reaching of potential customers in the   
presence of a limited budget for purchasing lists. Data   
from the customer survey have begun to trickle in.   
The information about the ten magazines to which a   
customer subscribes is provided on the returned ques-  
tionnaire. Harris has asked you to develop a prototype   
model, which later can be used to decide which lists to   
purchase. So far, only 53 surveys have been returned.   
To keep the prototype model manageable, Harris has   
instructed you to go ahead with the model develop-  
ment using the data from the 53 returned surveys.   
These data are shown in the table below. The costs of   
the first ten lists are given, and your budget is $3,000.

The demand for airline travel is quite sensitive to price.   
Typically, there is an inverse relationship between   
demand and price; when price decreases, demand   
increases, and vice versa. One major airline has found   
that when the price (

passengers per day. When the price is reduced to $400,   
demand is 1,200 passengers per day. You were asked   
to develop an appropriate model. Implement the model

ation: Modern Electronics sells two popular models   
of wireless headphones, model A and model B. The   
sales of these products are not independent of each   
other (in economics, we call these substitutable prod-  
ucts because if the price of one increases, sales of the   
other will increase). The store wishes to establish a   
pricing policy to maximize revenue from these prod-  
ucts. A study of price and sales data shows the fol-

pose that the hotel is considering adding suites to its   
room mix. Based on an analysis of local competitors,   
suites can sell for a rate of $180, and they expect to   
sell 20 per day to business travelers. The price elas-  
ticity of demand is estimated to be

Many manufacturing situations, for example, the pro-  
duction of such large and complex items as aircraft   
or machines, exhibit a learning effect in which the   
production time per unit decreases as more units are   
produced. This is often modeled by a power curve,

*y*

=

*ax*

, where

*a*

and

*b*

are constants. Suppose that

When the field of optimization was quite young, a wise professor stated that its

purpose is "insight, not numbers." In other words, there is much to be gleaned

from optimization models beyond just finding the optimal solution.

Solver

pro-

vides useful information about the impact of changes and variations in model

data on the optimal solution from its Sensitivity Report. In addition, modern

analytics provides a rich platform to conduct what-if analysis, provide further

insights that can help use optimization in practice, and to visualize results in order

to communicate them easily to non-technical managers.

In this chapter, we will focus on using what-if analysis in optimization, inter-

preting the

Solver

Sensitivity Report, and visualizing optimization results. We will

also discuss the special case of models with bounded variables and ensure that

sensitivity analysis is used properly.

[What-If Analysis for Optimization Models](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#15)

The principal purpose of formulating and solving an optimization model should never be   
to just find a "best answer"; rather, the model should be used to provide insight for making   
better decisions. Thus, it is important to analyze optimization models from a predictive ana-  
lytics perspective to determine what might happen should the model assumptions change   
or when the data used in the model are uncertain. For example, managers have some con-  
trol over pricing but may not be able to control supplier costs. Even though we may have   
solved a model to find an optimal solution, it would be beneficial to determine what impact   
a change in a price or cost would have on net profit. Similarly, many constraints represent   
resource limitations or customer commitments. Limited capacity can be adjusted through   
overtime, or supplier contracts can be renegotiated. So managers would want to know   
whether it would be worthwhile to increase capacity or change a contract. With

*Solver*

,

answers to such questions can easily be found by simply changing the data and re-solving   
the model.

EXAMPLE 15.1

Using

Solver

for What-If Analysis

In the Sklenka Ski Company (SSC) model, managers might   
wish to answer the following questions:

1.

Suppose that the unit profit on Jordanelle skis is   
increased by $10. How will the optimal solution   
change? What is the best product mix?

2.

Suppose that the unit profit on Jordanelle skis is   
decreased by $10 because of higher material costs.   
How will the optimal solution change? What is the best   
product mix?

3.

Suppose that ten additional finishing hours become   
available through overtime. How will manufacturing   
plans be affected?

4.

What if the number of finishing hours available is   
decreased by two hours because of planned equip-  
ment maintenance? How will manufacturing plans be   
affected?

[Figure 15.1 shows a summary of the solutions for each of](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#596)these scenarios after re-solving the model.

In the first scenario, when the unit profit of Jordanelle

skis is increased to $60, the optimal product mix does not   
change from the base scenario; however, the total profit   
increases. You might think that if the profit of Jordanelle   
skis increases, it would be advantageous to produce more   
of them. However, doing so would require producing more

For many models, we often want to conduct more systematic what-if analyses to exam-

ine how solutions change as input data vary within some reasonable ranges. For example,   
look back at the Innis Investment problem [(Example 13.16)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#524). In financial decisions such   
as these, it is often useful to compare risk versus reward to make an informed decision,   
particularly since the target return is subjective. We illustrate this in the following example.

▶

Figure 15.1

Summary of What-If   
Scenarios

Deercrest skis to meet the marketing mix constraint, which   
would then violate the finishing time constraint. Therefore,   
the solution is "maxed out," so to speak, because of the   
constraints. Nevertheless, each pair of Jordanelle skis   
produced would gain an additional $10 in profit, so the 5.25   
pairs we produce increase the profit by 5.25( $10)

=

$52.50

to $997.50. From a practical perspective, a manager might   
need to consider whether the price increase will still ensure   
that all the skis can be sold---an implicit assumption in the   
model.

In the second scenario, the situation is different. If

the profit of Jordanelle skis is reduced to $40, it becomes   
unprofitable to produce any of them. The marketing mix   
constraint is no longer relevant, and similar to the Crebo   
Manufacturing example, the profit per unit of finishing time   
is higher for Deercrest; consequently, it is best to produce   
only that model. Eliminating a product from the optimal

mix might be a poor marketing decision, or it can offer   
advantages by simplifying the supply chain.

In the third scenario, we see that we still have a mix of

both products. With the additional finishing hours, we are   
able to produce more of the higher-profit Deercrest skis and   
use the remaining capacity to produce a smaller amount   
of the Jordanelle skis. However, you can also see that we   
have now used all the fabrication hours as well as all the   
finishing hours, suggesting that the operations manager   
has no slack in fabrication; any breakdown of equipment or   
absence of labor will affect the solution.

Finally, in the last scenario, a small reduction in the

finishing capacity results in the same two-to-one ratio of   
Deercrest to Jordanelle skis because of the marketing mix   
constraint, but the reduction in finishing capacity reduced   
the amount of each product that can be produced, as well   
as reducing the overall profit by $90.

EXAMPLE 15.2

Evaluating Risk Versus Reward in Portfolio Management

In the Innis Investment problem, we might be interested in   
comparing how the return, risk, and investment mix would   
change for different values of the target return. [Figure 15.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#597)shows such an analysis for target returns between 4% and   
7%. We see that below 5%, we can obtain a return of 4.89%   
with a minimum risk. Visualizing these results can provide   
better insight. The chart on the right shows that as the target

return increases, the risk increases, and at 6%, begins to   
increase at a faster rate. As the target return increases, the   
investment mix begins to change to a higher percentage of   
low-price stock, which is a riskier investment, as shown in   
the chart on the left. A more conservative client might be   
willing to take a small amount of additional risk to achieve a   
6% return but not venture beyond that value.

know what would happen if the profit for Jordanelle skis is decreased only by $1, $2, or $5,   
and so on. We could keep changing the data and re-solving the model, but that would be

tedious. Fortunately, we can answer these and other what-if questions more easily by using   
the Sensitivity Report generated by

*Solver*

.

The

*Solver*

Sensitivity Report provides a variety of useful information for manage-

rial interpretation of the solution. Specifically, it allows us to understand how the optimal   
objective value and optimal decision variables are affected by changes in the objective   
function coefficients, the impact of forced changes in certain decision variables, or the   
impact of changes in the constraint resource limitations or requirements. [Figure 15.3](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#598)shows the Sensitivity Report for the SSC model, with annotations that summarize what the   
numbers represent. To obtain it, select

*Sensitivity Report*

in the

*Solver Results*

dialog. We

use this for the examples in this section.

*One important caution: The Sensitivity Report information applies to changes in only*

*one of the model parameters at a time; all others are assumed to remain at their original
values*

. In other words, you cannot accumulate or add the effects of sensitivity information

if you change the values of multiple parameters in a model simultaneously.

The

*Decision Variable Cells*

section provides information about the decision variables

and objective function coefficients and how changes in their values would affect the opti-  
mal solution.

EXAMPLE 15.3

Interpreting Sensitivity Information for Decision Variables

The

Decision Variable Cells

section lists the final value for

each decision variable, a number called the reduced cost,   
the coefficients associated with the decision variables   
from the objective function, and two numbers called   
allowable increase and allowable decrease. The

reduced

cost

tells

how much the objective coefficient needs to

be reduced for a nonnegative variable that is zero in   
the optimal solution to become positive

. If a variable is

positive in the optimal solution, as it is for both variables   
in the SSC example, its reduced cost is always zero. We   
will see an example later that will help you to understand   
reduced costs.

The range within which the objective function coefficients will not change the optimal

solution provides a manager with some confidence about the stability of the solution in the   
face of uncertainty. If the allowable ranges are large, then reasonable errors in estimating   
the coefficients will have no effect on the optimal policy (although they will affect the   
value of the objective function). Tight ranges suggest that more effort might be spent in   
ensuring that accurate data or estimates are used in the model.

Figure 15.3

Sensitivity Report

The Allowable Increase and Allowable Decrease values

tell how much an individual objective function coefficient   
can change before the optimal values of the decision   
variables will change (a value listed as "1E

+

30" is

interpreted as infinity). For example, the Allowable Increase   
for Deercrest skis is 10, and the Allowable Decrease is 90.   
This means that if the unit profit for Deercrest skis, $65,   
either increases by more than 10 or decreases by more   
than 90, then the optimal values of the decision variables   
will change (as long as all other objective coefficients   
stay the same). For instance, if we increase the unit profit   
by $11 (to $76) and re-solve the model, the new optimal   
solution will be to produce 14 pairs of Deercrest skis and   
no Jordanelle skis. However, any increase of less than 10   
will keep the current solution optimal. For Jordanelle skis,   
we can increase the unit profit as much as we wish without   
affecting the current optimal solution; however, a decrease   
of at least 6.66 will force a change in the solution.

If the objective coefficient of any one variable that has

positive value in the current solution changes but stays   
within the range specified by the Allowable Increase and   
Allowable Decrease, the optimal decision variables will   
stay the same; however,

the objective function value will

change

. For example, if the unit profit of Jordanelle skis

were changed to $46 (a decrease of $4, which is within the   
Allowable Increase), then we are guaranteed that the optimal   
solution will still be to produce 5.25 pairs of Jordanelle   
skis and 10.5 pairs of Deercrest skis. However, each of   
the 5.25 pairs of Jordanelle skis produced and sold would   
realize $4 less profit---a total decrease of 5.25( $4)

=

$21.

Thus, the new value of the objective function would be   
$945

-

$21

=

$924. If an objective coefficient changes

beyond the Allowable Increase or Allowable Decrease, then   
we must re-solve the problem with the new value to find the   
new optimal solution and profit.

Chapter 15

Optimization Analytics

To understand what a nonzero reduced cost means, let us use the second scenario in

[Example 15.1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#595)

EXAMPLE 15.4

Understanding Nonzero Reduced Costs

[Figure 15.4 shows the Sensitivity Report when the unit](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#599)profit for Jordanelle skis is $40. As before, the reduced cost   
for Deercrest skis is 0 because the value of the variable   
is positive. We do not produce any Jordanelle skis in this   
optimal solution simply because it is not profitable to do   
so. Using the definition of the reduced cost,

how much the

objective coefficient needs to be reduced for a nonnegative   
variable that is zero in the optimal solution to become

positive

, we see that the profit on Jordanelle skis must be

reduced by more than

-

$3.33 (or equivalently,

increased

by more than $3.33) to make it profitable to produce them.   
If you re-solve the model with the unit profit for Jordanelle   
as $43.34, you will obtain the original optimal product mix   
(except that the total profit will be $910.04 because of the   
different objective function coefficient).

Interpreting Sensitivity Information for Constraints

[In the fabrication constraint (see Figure 15.3), we are using](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#598)only 60.375 of the 84 available hours in the optimal solution.   
Thus, having one more hour available will not help us to   
increase our profit. However, if a constraint is binding, then   
any change in the right-hand side will cause the optimal   
values of the decision variables as well as the objective   
function value to change. We illustrate this with the finishing   
constraint.

The shadow price of the finishing constraint is 45.

This means that if an additional hour of finishing time is   
available, then the total profit will change by $45. To see   
this, change the limitation of the number of finishing hours   
available to 22 and re-solve the problem. The new solution   
is to produce 5.5 pairs of Jordanelle skis and 11.0 pairs of   
Deercrest skis, yielding a profit of $990. We see that the   
total profit increases by $45, as predicted.

The

*Constraints*

section of the Sensitivity Report lists the final value of the constraint

function (the left-hand side), a number called the shadow price, the original right-hand-side   
value of the constraint, and an Allowable Increase and Allowable Decrease. The

**shadow**

**price**

tells

*how much the value of the objective function will change as the right-hand side*

*of a constraint is increased by 1*

. Whenever a constraint has positive slack (the difference

between the left- and right-hand side of the constraint for the optimal solution as defined   
in Chapter 13), the shadow price is zero. When a constraint involves a limited resource, the   
shadow price represents the economic value of having an additional unit of that resource.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive600.png)

Chapter 15

Optimization Analytics

571

Shadow prices are useful to a manager because they provide guidance on how to real-

locate resources or change values over which the manager may have control. In linear opti-  
mization models, the parameters of some constraints cannot be controlled. For instance,   
the amount of time available for production or physical limitations on machine capacities   
would clearly be uncontrollable. Other constraints represent policy decisions, which, in   
essence, are arbitrary. Although it is correct to state that having an additional hour of fin-  
ishing time will improve profit by $45, does this necessarily mean that the company should   
spend up to this amount for additional hours? This depends on whether the relevant costs   
have been included in the objective function coefficients. If the cost of labor

*has not*

been

included in the objective function unit profit coefficients, then the company will benefit by   
paying less than $45 for additional hours. However, if the cost of labor

*has*

been included in

the profit calculations, the company should be willing to pay up to an

*additional*

$45 over

and above the labor costs that have already been included in the unit profit calculations.

The Limits Report ([Figure 15.5)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#600) shows the lower limit and upper limit that each

variable can assume while satisfying all constraints and holding all the other variables

The shadow price is a valid predictor of the change

in the objective function value for each unit of increase in   
the right-hand side of the constraint up to the value of the   
Allowable Increase. Thus, if up to about 8.2 additional hours   
of finishing time were available, profit would increase by   
$45 for each additional hour (but we would have to re-solve   
the problem to actually find the optimal values of the   
decision variables). Similarly, a negative of the shadow price   
predicts the change in the objective function value for each   
unit the constraint's right-hand side is

decreased

, up to the

value of the Allowable Decrease. For example, if one person   
were ill or injured, resulting in only 14 hours of finishing time   
available, then profit would decrease by 7($45)

=

$315,

resulting in a total profit of $945

-

$315

=

$630. This

can be predicted because a decrease of 7 hours is within   
the Allowable Decrease of 21. Beyond these ranges, the   
shadow price does not predict what will happen, and the   
problem must be re-solved.

Another way of understanding the shadow price is to

break down the impact of a change in the right-hand side   
of the value. How was the extra hour of finishing time used?   
After solving the model with 22 hours of finishing time, we

see that we were able to produce an additional 0.25 pairs of   
Jordanelle skis and 0.5 pairs of Deercrest skis as compared   
to the original solution. Therefore, the profit increased by   
0.25($50)

+

0.5(65)

=

$12.50

+

32.50

=

$45. In essence,

a small change in a binding constraint causes a reallocation   
of how the resources are used.

Interpreting the shadow price associated with the

market mixture constraint is a bit more difficult. If you   
examine the constraint

Deercrest

-

Jordanelle

Ú

closely, an increase in the right-hand side from 0 to 1   
results in a change of the constraint to

(

Deercrest

-

1)

-

2 Jordanelle

Ú

0

This means that the number of pairs of Deercrest skis   
produced would be one short of the requirement that it be   
at least twice the number of Jordanelle skis. If the problem   
is re-solved with this constraint, we find the new optimal   
solution to be 4.875 Jordanelle skis, 10.75 Deercrest skis,   
and profit

=

$942.50. The profit changed by the value of

the shadow price, and we see that 2

[Using the Sensitivity Report](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#15)

It is easy to use the sensitivity information to evaluate the impact of different scenarios.   
The following rules summarize how to do this.

**a.**

If a change in an objective function coefficient remains within the Allowable   
Increase and Allowable Decrease ranges in the

*Decision Variable Cells*

sec-

tion of the report, then the optimal values of the decision variables will not   
change. However, you must recalculate the value of the objective function   
using the new value of the coefficient.

**b.**

If a change in an objective function coefficient exceeds the Allowable Increase   
or Allowable Decrease limits in the

*Decision Variable Cells*

section of the

report, then you must re-solve the model to find the new optimal values.

**c.**

If a change in the right-hand side of a constraint remains within the Allow-  
able Increase and Allowable Decrease ranges in the

*Constraints*

section of

the report, then the shadow price allows you to predict how the objective   
function value will change. Multiply the change in the right-hand side (posi-  
tive if an increase, negative if a decrease) by the value of the shadow price.   
However, you must re-solve the model to find the new values of the decision   
variables.

**d.**

If a change in the right-hand side of a constraint exceeds the Allowable   
Increase or Allowable Decrease limits in the

*Constraints*

section of the

report, then you cannot predict how the objective function value will change   
using the shadow price. You must re-solve the problem to find the new   
solution.

We will illustrate these rules for the SSC what-i[f scenarios (see Example 15.1) using](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#595)

EXAMPLE 15.6

Using the Sensitivity Report to Evaluate Scenarios

1.

Suppose that the unit profit on Jordanelle skis is   
increased by $10. How will the optimal solution change?   
What is the best product mix?

The first thing to do is to determine if the increase in   
the objective function coefficient is within the range   
of the Allowable Increase and Allowable Decrease   
in the

Decision Variable Cells

portion of the report.

Because $10 is less than the Allowable Increase   
of infinity, we can safely conclude that the optimal   
quantities of the decision variables will not change.   
However, because the objective function changed,   
we need to compute the new value of the total profit:   
5.25($60)

+

10.5($65)

=

$997.50.

2.

Suppose that the unit profit on Jordanelle skis is   
decreased by $10 because of higher material costs.   
How will the optimal solution change? What is the best   
product mix?

In this case, the change in the unit profit exceeds the   
Allowable Decrease ($6.67). We can conclude that the   
optimal values of the decision variables will change, al-  
though we must re-solve the problem to determine what   
the new values would be.

3.

Suppose that ten additional finishing hours become   
available through overtime. How will manufacturing   
plans be affected?

When the scenario relates to the right-hand side of a   
constraint, first check if the change in the right-hand-  
side value is within the range of the Allowable Increase   
and Allowable Decrease in the

Constraints

section of

the report. In this case, ten additional finishing hours   
exceeds the Allowable Increase. Therefore, we must re-  
solve the problem to determine the new solution.

4.

A solution is a

**degenerate solution**

if the right-hand-side value of any constraint has

a zero Allowable Increase or Allowable Decrease. A full discussion of the implications   
of degeneracy is beyond the scope of this book; however, it is important to know that   
degeneracy can impact the interpretation of sensitivity analysis information. For example,   
reduced costs and shadow prices may not be unique, and you may have to change objec-  
tive function coefficients beyond their allowable increases or decreases before the optimal   
solution will change. Thus, some caution should be exercised when interpreting the infor-  
mation. When in doubt, consult a business analytics expert.

Constraints section provides the value for the left-hand   
side of each constraint in the Cell Value column, its binding   
or nonbinding status, and the value of the slack. In this   
example, we see that the limit of 450 rooms and the   
lower bound on the price of a gold room are binding. This   
suggests that we could increase revenue if we could either   
increase the capacity of the hotel or lower the minimum   
price for a gold room.

In the Adjustable Cells section of the Sensitivity Report

[(Figure 15.7), the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#603)

Reduced Gradient

is analogous to the

Reduced Cost

in linear models. For this problem, however,

the objective function coefficient of each price depends on   
many parameters; therefore, the reduced gradient is more   
difficult to interpret in relation to the problem data. Thus, we   
cannot necessarily conclude that a decrease in the price of   
a gold room of $42.69 will force a change in the solution.

Lagrange Multipliers

in the Constraints section are

similar to shadow prices for linear models. However, for   
nonlinear models, the Lagrange multipliers give only an

approximate

rate of change in the objective function as

the right-hand side of a binding constraint is increased by   
1 unit. Thus, for this example, if the number of available   
rooms is increased by 1 to 451, the total revenue would   
increase by

approximately

$12.08. (For linear models,

as we have seen, shadow prices give the

exact

rate of

change within the Allowable Increase and Allowable   
Decrease limits.) Thus, you should be somewhat   
cautious when interpreting these values and will need   
to re-solve the models to find the true effect of changes   
to constraints. For this example, the optimal revenue   
for a 451-room capacity is $39,392.52, an increase of   
$39,392.52

affected?

In this case, a decrease of two hours in finishing capac-  
ity is within the Allowable Decrease. We may conclude   
that the total profit will decrease by the value of the

shadow price for each hour that finishing capacity is de-  
creased. Therefore, we can predict that the total profit   
will decrease by 2

this to increase the efficiency of the solution procedure used; for large models, this can   
represent significant savings in computer-processing time. However, this makes it more   
difficult to interpret the sensitivity information because we no longer have the shadow   
prices and allowable increases and decreases associated with these constraints. Actually,   
this isn't quite true; the shadow prices are there but are hidden in the reduced costs.   
Fortunately, there is simple approach to provide the missing information that we will   
describe shortly.

EXAMPLE 15.8

J\&M Manufacturing

Suppose that J\&M Manufacturing makes four models of   
gas grills, A, B, C, and D. Each grill must flow through five   
departments: stamping, painting, assembly, inspection,   
[and packaging. Table 15.1 shows the relevant data. In](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#605)the second table, for instance, the stamping department   
can produce 40 units of model A each hour. (Grill A uses   
imported parts and does not require painting.) J\&M wants   
to determine how many grills to make to maximize monthly   
profit.

To formulate this as a linear optimization model, let

D to produce, respectively

The objective function is to maximize the total net profit:

The constraints include limitations on the amount of pro-  
duction hours available in each department, the minimum   
sales requirements, and maximum sales potential limits.   
Here is an example of a situation where you must carefully   
look at the dimensions of the data. The production rates are   
given in units/hour, so if you multiply these values by the   
number of units produced, you will have an expression that   
makes no sense. Therefore, you must divide the decision

variables by units per hour---or, equivalently, convert these   
data to hours/unit---and then multiply by the decision   
variables:

For   
example, we see that the upper bound on model D and lower bound on model B are bind-  
ing. However, none of the bound constraints appear in the Constraints section of the Sen-  
sitivity Report.

First, let us interpret the reduced costs. Recall that in an ordinary model with only

nonnegativity constraints and no other simple bounds, the reduced cost tells how much the   
objective coefficient needs to be reduced for a variable to become positive in an optimal   
solution. For product B, we have the lower bound constraint

*B*

Ú

0. Note that the optimal

solution specifies that we produce only the minimum amount required. Why? It is simply   
not economical to produce more because the profit contribution of B is too low relative to   
the other products. How much more would the profit on B have to be for it to be economi-  
cal to produce anything other than the minimum amount required? The answer is given by   
the reduced cost. The unit profit on B would have to be reduced by at least

-

$1.905 (that

is,

*increased*

by at least

+

$1.905). If a nonzero lower-bound constraint is binding, the

interpretation is similar; the reduced cost is the amount the unit profit would have to be   
reduced to produce more than the minimum amount.

For product D, the reduced cost is $19.29. Note that D is at its upper bound, 1,000. We

want to produce as much of D as possible because it generates a large profit. How much   
would the unit profit have to be

*lowered*

before it is no longer economical to produce the

maximum amount? Again, the answer is the reduced cost, $19.29.

Now, let's ask these questions in a different way. For product B, what would the effect

be of increasing the right-hand-side value of the bound constraint,

*B*

Ú

0, by 1 unit? If we

increase the right-hand side of a lower-bound constraint by 1, we are essentially forcing   
the solution to produce one more than the minimum requirement. How would the objective   
function change if we do this? It would have to decrease because we would lose money by   
producing an extra unit of a nonprofitable product. How much? The answer again is the   
reduced cost. Producing an additional unit of product B will result in a profit reduction of   
$1.905. Similarly, increasing the right-hand side of the constraint

*D*

1,000 by 1 will

Because integer models are discontinuous by their very nature, sensitivity information can-  
not be generated in the same manner as for linear models; therefore, no Sensitivity Report   
is provided by

*Solver*

---only the Answer Report is available. To investigate changes in

model parameters, it is necessary to re-solve the model. In the following example, we   
show how integer optimization models can be used in locating facilities and apply what-if   
analysis to examine trade-offs among different solutions. This example is often called a   
"covering" problem, because we seek to choose a subset of locations that serve, or cover,   
all locations in a service area.

EXAMPLE 15.10

Anderson Village Fire Stations

Suppose that an unincorporated village wishes to find the   
best locations for fire stations. Assume that the village is   
divided into smaller districts, or neighborhoods, and that   
transportation studies have estimated the response time for   
emergency vehicles to travel between each pair of districts.   
The village wants to locate the fire stations so that all   
districts can be reached within eight minutes. The following   
table shows the estimated response time in minutes   
between each pair of districts:

As you certainly know by now, interpreting the output from

*Solver*

requires some techni-

cal knowledge of linear optimization concepts and terminology, such as reduced costs and   
shadow prices. Data visualization can help analysts present optimization results in forms that   
are more understandable and can be easily explained to managers and clients in a report or   
presentation. We will illustrate this using a process selection model. Process selection models   
generally involve choosing among different types of processes to produce a good. Make-or-  
buy decisions are examples of process selection models, whereby we must choose whether to   
make one or more products in-house or subcontract them out to another firm.

EXAMPLE 15.11

What-If Analysis for Response Time

In the Anderson Village example, we changed the   
response time requirement in cell B8 to vary between 5   
and 10 minutes, and re-solved the model for each value.   
[The results are shown in Figure 15.17. In column A are the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#612)values of the response time. The 1s in columns B through   
H show where the fire stations should be located. Column   
I shows the minimum number of fire stations required.

These results show the maximum response time can be   
reduced to six minutes while still using only two fire stations   
(the model solution yields districts 1 and 3). This would   
clearly be a better alternative. Also, if the response time is   
increased by only one minute from its original target, the   
township could save the cost of building a second facility.   
Of course, such decisions need to be evaluated carefully.

EXAMPLE 15.12

Camm Textiles

Camm Textiles has a mill that produces three types of   
fabrics on a make-to-order basis. The mill operates on a   
24/7 schedule. The key decision facing the plant manager   
is about the type of loom needed to process each fabric   
during the coming quarter (13 weeks) to meet demands   
for the three fabrics and not exceed the capacity of the   
looms in the mill. Two types of looms are used: dobbie   
and regular. Dobbie looms can be used to make all fabrics

and are the only looms that can weave certain fabrics,   
such as plaids. Demands, variable costs for each fabric,   
[and production rates on the looms are given in Table 15.2.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#613)The mill has 15 regular looms and 3 dobbie looms. After   
weaving, fabrics are sent to the finishing department and   
then sold. Any fabrics that cannot be woven in the mill   
because of limited capacity will be purchased from an   
external supplier, finished at the mill, and sold at the selling

price. In addition to determining which looms to use to   
process the fabrics, the manager also needs to determine   
which fabrics to buy externally.

To formulate a linear optimization model, define

D

i

=

number of yards of fabric

i

to produce on dobbie

looms,

i

=

1, 2, 3. That is,

D

1

=

number of yards of fabric

1 to produce on dobbie looms,

D

2

=

number of yards of

fabric 2 to produce on dobbie looms, and

D

3

=

number of

yards of fabric 3 to produce on dobbie looms. In a similar   
fashion, define the following:

R

i

=

number of yards of fabric

i

to produce on

regular looms,

i

=

2, 3 only

P

i

=

number of yards of fabric

i

to purchase from

an outside supplier,

i

=

1, 2, 3

Note that we are using

subscripted variables

to simplify

their definition rather than defining nine individual variables   
with unique names.

The objective function is to minimize total cost, found

by multiplying the cost per yard based on the mill cost or   
outsourcing by the number of yards of fabric for each type   
of decision variable:

Constraints to ensure meeting production requirements are

This constraint states that the amount of fabric 1 pro-  
duced on dobbie looms or outsourced must equal the total   
demand of 45,000 yards. The constraints for the other two   
fabrics are

To specify the constraints on loom capacity, we must

convert yards per hour into hours per yard. For example, for   
fabric 1 on a dobbie loom, 4.7 yards/hour

=

0.213 hour/yard.

Therefore, the term 0.213

D

represents the total time

required to produce

(hours/yard

yards). The total capacity for dobbie looms is

We can easily see that the utilization   
of regular looms is approximately half the capacity, while dobbie looms are fully utilized,   
suggesting that the purchase of additional dobbie looms might be useful, at least under the   
current demand scenario.

We may also visualize the ranges over which the unit cost coefficients may change

without changing the optimal values of the decision variables by using an Excel

*Stock*

. A stock chart typically shows the "high-low-close" values of daily stock prices;

here we can compute the maximum-minimum-current values of the unit cost coefficients.   
To do this, follow these steps (for Windows; Mac menus are slightly different):

**1.**

Create a table in the worksheet by adding the Allowable Increase values and   
subtracting the Allowable Decrease values from the cost coefficients, as shown   
in[Table 15.3.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#617)Replace 1E

30 by #N/A in the worksheet so that infinite

values are not displayed.

*Note: You must have at least three rows in the table to*

*create a stock chart*

.

**2.**

Highlight the range of this table and insert an Excel

*Stock Chart*

and name the

series as Maximum, Minimum, and Current.

**3.**

Click the chart, and in the

tab of

*Chart Tools*

says "Chart Area"). Find the series you wish to format and then click

Choose the type of marker you want and increase the width of the markers to   
make them more visible. We chose the green symbol

for the current value,

a red triangle for the minimum value, and a blue dash for the maximum value.   
This results in the chart sho[wn in Figure 15.25.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#618)

Now it is easy to visualize the allowable unit cost ranges. For those lines that have no

maximum limit (the blue dash) such as with Fabric 1 Purchased, the unit costs can increase   
to infinity; for those that have no lower limit (the red triangle) such as Fabric 1 on Dobbie,   
the unit costs can decrease indefinitely.

Shadow prices show the impact of changing the right-hand side of a binding con-

straint. Because the plant operates on a 24/7 schedule, changes in loom capacity would   
require they be in "chunks" (that is, purchasing an additional loom) rather than incremen-  
tal. However, changes in the demand can easily be assessed using the shadow price infor-

EXAMPLE 15.13

Walker Wines

A small winery, Walker Wines, buys grapes from local   
growers and blends the pressings to make two types of   
wine: Shiraz and merlot.

1

It costs $1.60 to purchase the

grapes needed to make a bottle of Shiraz and $1.40 to   
purchase the grapes needed to make a bottle of merlot. The   
contract requires that they provide at least 40% but not   
more than 70% Shiraz. Based on market research, it is   
estimated that the base demand for Shiraz is 1,000 bottles,   
but demand increases by five bottles for each $1 spent on   
advertising; the base demand for merlot is 2,000 bottles and   
increases by eight bottles for each $1 spent on advertising.   
Production should not exceed demand. Shiraz sells to retail   
stores for a wholesale price of $6.25 per bottle and merlot is   
sold for $5.25 per bottle. Walker Wines has $50,000   
available to purchase grapes and advertise its products,   
with an objective of maximizing profit contribution.

One crucial assumption in interpreting sensitivity analysis information for changes in   
model parameters is that all other model parameters are held constant. It is easy to fall   
into a trap of ignoring this assumption and blindly crunching through the numbers. This

Sensitivity Report. A variety

of practical questions can be posed around the Sensitivity   
Report. For example, suppose that the accountant noticed   
a small error in computing the profit contribution for Shiraz.   
The cost of Shiraz grapes should have been $1.65 instead   
of $1.60. How will this affect the solution?

In the model formulation, you can see that a $0.05

increase in cost results in a drop in the unit profit of Shiraz   
from $4.65 to $4.60. In the Sensitivity Report, however,   
the change in the profit coefficient is within the allowable   
decrease of 0.05328; thus, we might conclude that no

change in the optimal solution will result. However, this is

not

the correct interpretation. If the model is re-solved using

the new cost parameter, the solution changes dramatically,   
[as shown in Figure 15.31.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#622)

Why did this happen? In this case, the unit cost is also

reflected in the binding budget constraint. When we change   
the cost parameter, the constraint also changes. This   
violates the assumption that all other model parameters are   
held constant. The change causes the budget constraint   
to become infeasible, and the solution must be adjusted to   
maintain feasibility.

As we noted, interpreting sensitivity analysis information for a change in a model

parameter assumes that

*all other model parameters are held constant*

. Let's see how this

applies to the Walker Wines example.

This example points out the importance of fully understanding the mathematical

model when analyzing sensitivity information. One suggestion to ensure that sensitiv-  
ity analysis information is interpreted properly in spreadsheet models is to use Excel's   
formula-auditing capability. If you select the cost of Shiraz (cell B5) and apply the   
"Trace Dependents" command from the

*Formula Auditing*

menu, you will see that the

unit cost influences both the unit profit (cell B30)

*and*

Excel Techniques

*Obtaining the Solver Sensitivity Report*

:

After solving a linear or nonlinear optimization model,   
click on the

*Sensitivity Report*

in the

*Solver Results*

dialog,

and then click

*OK*

.

*Using auxiliary variables in Solver models*

[(Example 15.9):](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#608)Define a new set of cells in the spreadsheet model for   
any decision variables having upper or lower bounds   
that reference the original changing cells. In the

*Solver*

model, use the auxiliary variable cells to define the bound   
constraints.

*Creating a stock chart to visualize allowable increases
and allowable decreases in Sensitivity Reports*

:

**1.**

Create a table in the worksheet by adding the Allow-  
able Increase values and subtracting the Allowable   
Decrease values from the cost coefficients. Replace   
any 1E

+

30 values by #N/A in the worksheet so that

infinite values are not displayed.

**2.**

Highlight the range of this table and insert an Excel

*Stock Chart*

and name the series as Maximum, Mini-

mum, and Current.

**3.**

Click the chart, and in the

*Format*

tab of

*Chart Tools*

,

go to the

*Current Selection*

group to the left of the rib-

bon and click on the drop-down box (it usually says   
"Chart Area"). Find the series you wish to format and   
then click

*Format Selection*

.

**4.**

In the

*Format Data Series*

pane that appears in the

worksheet, click the paint icon and then

*Marker*

What-If Analysis for Optimization Models

1.

For the Valencia Products scenario (Problems 4 and 11   
in [Chapter 13)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494), use the spreadsheet model to answer   
the following questions by changing the parameters   
and re-solving the model. Answer each question inde-  
pendently relative to the original problem.

a.

If the unit profit for SpeedBuster is decreased to   
$130, how will the optimal solution and profit   
change?

b.

If the unit profit for LaserStop is increased to $210,   
how will the optimal solution and profit change?

c.

If an additional 1,500 units of component A are   
available, can you predict how the optimal solu-  
tion and profit will be affected?

d.

If a supplier delay results in only 3,000 units   
of component B being available, can you pre-  
dict how the optimal solution and profit will be   
affected? Can you explain the result?

2.

For the ColPal Products scenario (Problems 5 and   
12 in [Chapter 13)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494), use the spreadsheet model to   
answer the following questions by changing the   
parameters and re-solving the model. Answer each   
question independently relative to the original   
problem.

a.

Suppose that the exposure for TV advertising   
was incorrectly estimated and should have been   
875. How would the optimal solution have been   
affected?

6 and 13 in [Chapter 13](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#494)), use the spreadsheet model to   
answer the following questions by changing the param-  
eters and re-solving the model. Answer each question   
independently relative to the original problem.

a.

If 25% of the pine is deemed to be cosmeti-  
cally defective, how will the optimal solution be   
affected?

b.

The shop supervisor is suggesting that the work-  
force be allowed to work an additional 50 hours at

to $280, how will the optimal solution and total   
profit be affected?

d.

If the unit profit of standard desks is only $190,

For the Markowitz model in[Example 14.10,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#572) deter-

mine how the minimum variance and stock alloca-  
tions change as the target return varies between 8%   
and 12% (in increments of 1%) by re-solving the

Marketing managers have various media alternatives   
in which to advertise and must determine which to   
use, the number of insertions in each, and the timing   
of insertions to maximize advertising effectiveness   
within a limited budget. Suppose that three media   
options are available to Kernan Services Corpora-  
tion: radio, TV, and magazine. The following table   
provides some information about costs, exposure val-  
ues, and bounds on the permissible number of ads in   
each medium desired by the firm. The exposure value   
is a measure of the number of people exposed to the   
advertisement and is derived from market research   
studies. The company would like to achieve a total   
exposure value of at least 90,000.

Chapter 16

Decision Analysis

Everybody makes decisions, both personal and professional. Managers are con-

tinually faced with decisions involving new products, supply chain configurations,

new equipment, downsizing, and many others. The ability to make good deci-

sions is the mark of a successful (and promotable) manager. In today's complex

business world, intuition alone is not sufficient. This is where analytics plays an

important role.

Throughout this book, we have discussed how to analyze data and models

using methods of business analytics. Predictive models such as Monte Carlo

simulations can provide insight about the impacts of potential decisions, and

prescriptive models such as linear optimization provide recommendations

as to the best course of action to take. However, the real purpose of such

information is to help managers

make decisions

. Their decisions often have

significant economic or human resource consequences that cannot always be

predicted accurately. For example, in[Chapter 12,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#452) we analyzed a simulation

model for new product development ([Example 12.11)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#467). In assessing the risks,

we observed that the probability that the net present value would not be posi-

tive was between 0.15 and 0.20. So what decision (pursue the project or not)

should the company make? Similarly, in the Innis Investment example in [Chap](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#594)-

[ter 15,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#594) we performed a scenario analysis to evaluate the trade-offs between

risk and return ([Figure 15.2)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#597). How should the client make a trade-off between

risk and return for their portfolio?

Analytic models and analyses provide decision makers with a wealth of

information; however, people make the final decision. Good decisions don't

simply implement the results of analytic models; they require an assessment

of intangible factors and risk attitudes.

Decision analysis

is the study of how

people make decisions, particularly when faced with imperfect or uncertain

information, as well as a collection of techniques to support decision choices.

Decision analysis differs from other modeling approaches by explicitly consid-

ering the individual's preferences and attitudes toward risk and modeling the

decision process itself.

Decisions involving uncertainty and risk have been studied for many years. A

large body of knowledge has been developed that helps to explain the philosophy

associated with making decisions and also provides techniques for incorporating

uncertainty and risk in making decisions.

Many decisions involve a choice from among a small set of alternatives with uncertain   
consequences. We may formulate such decision problems by defining three things:

**1.**

the

**decision alternatives**

that can be chosen,

**2.**

the

**uncertain events**

that may occur after a decision is made along with their

possible

**outcomes**

, and

**3.**

the consequences associated with each decision and outcome, which are usually   
expressed as

**payoffs**

.

The outcomes associated with uncertain events (which are often called

**states of nature**

),

are defined so that one and only one of them will occur. They may be quantitative or quali-  
tative. For instance, in selecting the size of a new factory, the future demand for the product   
would be an uncertain event. The demand outcomes might be expressed quantitatively   
in sales units or dollars. On the other hand, suppose that you are planning a spring break   
vacation to Florida. You might define an uncertain event as the weather; these outcomes   
might be characterized qualitatively: sunny and warm, sunny and cold, rainy and warm,   
rainy and cold, and so on. A payoff is a measure of the value of making a decision and   
having a particular outcome occur. This might be a simple estimate made judgmentally or   
a value computed from a complex spreadsheet model. Payoffs are often summarized in a

**payoff table**

, a matrix whose rows correspond to decisions and whose columns correspond

to events. The decision maker first selects a decision alternative, after which one of the   
outcomes of the uncertain event occurs, resulting in the payoff.

EXAMPLE 16.1

Selecting a Mortgage Instrument

Many young families face the decision of choosing   
a mortgage instrument. Suppose the Durr family is   
considering purchasing a new home and would like   
to finance $150,000. Three mortgage options are   
available: a one-year adjusted-rate mortgage (ARM)   
at a low interest rate, a three-year ARM at a slightly   
higher rate, and a 30-year fixed mortgage at the highest   
rate. However, both ARMs are sensitive to interest rate   
changes and the rates may change, resulting in either   
higher or lower interest charges; thus, the potential future   
change in interest rates represents an uncertain event.   
Because the family anticipates staying in the home for at   
least five years, they want to know the total interest costs   
they might incur; these represent the payoffs associated   
with their choice and the future change in interest rates

and can easily be calculated using a spreadsheet. The   
payoff table is given below.

Clearly, no decision is best for each event that may

occur. If rates rise, for example, then the 30-year fixed   
would be the best decision. If rates remain stable or fall,   
however, then the one-year ARM is best. Of course, you   
cannot predict the future outcome with certainty, so the   
question is how to choose one of the options. Not everyone   
views risk in the same fashion. Most individuals will weigh   
their potential losses against potential gains. For example,   
if they choose the one-year ARM mortgage instead of the   
fixed-rate mortgage, they risk losing money if rates rise;   
however, they would clearly save a lot if rates remain stable   
or fall. Would the potential savings be worth the risk? Such   
questions make decision making a difficult task.

We discuss several quantitative approaches that model different risk behaviors for making   
decisions involving uncertainty when no probabilities can be estimated for the outcomes.

Aggressive (Optimistic) Strategy

An aggressive decision maker might seek the

option that holds the promise of minimizing the potential loss. This type of decision   
maker would first ask the question, What is the

*best*

that could result from each decision?

and then choose the decision that corresponds to the "best of the best." For a minimiza-  
tion objective, this strategy is also often called a

**minimin strategy**

; that is, we choose the

decision that minimizes the minimum payoff that can occur among all outcomes for each   
decision. Aggressive decision makers are often called speculators, particularly in financial   
arenas, because they increase their exposure to risk in hopes of increasing their return;   
while a few may be lucky, most will not do very well.

1.

List the three things that must be specified in formulating a decision problem from   
among a small set of alternatives with uncertain consequences.

2.

Explain the structure of a payoff table.

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

EXAMPLE 16.2

Mortgage Decision with the Aggressive Strategy

For the mortgage selection example, we find the best payoff---that is, the lowest-cost outcome---for each decision:

$54,658

$54,658

$54,658

Because the goal is to minimize costs, we would choose the one-year ARM.

Conservative (Pessimistic) Strategy

A conservative decision maker, on the

other hand, might take a more pessimistic attitude, asking "What is the worst thing   
that might result from my decision?" and then select the decision that represents the   
"best of the worst." Such a strategy is also known as a

**minimax strategy**

because we

seek the decision that minimizes the largest payoff that can occur among all outcomes   
for each decision. Conservative decision makers are willing to forgo high returns to   
avoid undesirable losses. This rule typically models the rational behavior of most   
individuals.  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive636.png)

Chapter 16

Decision Analysis

607

Opportunity-Loss Strategy

A third approach that underlies decision choices for

many individuals is to consider the

*opportunity loss*

associated with a decision. Opportu-

nity loss represents the "regret" that people often feel after making a nonoptimal decision   
(I should have bought that stock years ago!). In general, the opportunity loss associated   
with any decision and event is the absolute difference between the

*best*

decision for that

particular outcome and the payoff for the decision that was chosen.

*Opportunity losses*

*can be only nonnegative values*

. If you get a negative number, then you made a mistake.

Once opportunity losses are computed, the decision strategy is similar to a conservative   
strategy. The decision maker would select the decision that minimizes the largest oppor-  
tunity loss among all outcomes for each decision. For these reasons, this is also called a

**minimax regret strategy**

.

EXAMPLE 16.3

Mortgage Decision with the Conservative Strategy

For the mortgage decision problem, we first find the worst payoff---that is, the largest cost for each option:

Outcome

Decision

Rates Rise

Rates Stable

Rates Fall

$46,721

$56,901

30-year fixed

$54,658

$54,658

$54,658

$54,658

In this case, we want to choose the decision that has the smallest worst payoff, or the 30-year fixed mortgage. Thus, no   
matter what the future holds, a minimum cost of $54,658 is guaranteed.

EXAMPLE 16.4

Mortgage Decision with the Opportunity-Loss Strategy

In our scenario, suppose we chose the 30-year fixed   
mortgage and later find out that the interest rates had   
risen. We could not have done any better by selecting   
a different decision; in this case, the opportunity loss is   
zero. However, if we had chosen the three-year ARM,   
we would have paid $56,901 instead of $54,658 with the   
30-year fixed instrument, or $56,901

-

$54,658

=

$2,243

more. This represents the opportunity loss associated with   
making a nonoptimal decision. Similarly, had we chosen   
the one-year ARM, we would have incurred an additional

cost (opportunity loss) of $61,134

-

$54,658

=

$6,476. We

repeat this analysis for the other two outcomes and compute   
the opportunity losses, as summarized in the table below.

Then, we find the maximum opportunity loss that

would be incurred for each decision. The best decision is   
the one with the smallest maximum opportunity loss. Using   
this strategy, we would choose the one-year ARM. This   
ensures that, no matter what outcome occurs, we will never   
be more than $6,476 away from the least cost we could   
have incurred.

When the objective is to maximize the payoff, we can still apply aggressive, conservative,   
and opportunity-loss strategies, but we must make some key changes in the analysis.

■

■

For the aggressive strategy, the best payoff for each decision would be the

*largest*

value among all outcomes, and we would choose the decision corresponding to   
the largest of these, called a

**maximax strategy**

.

■

■

For the conservative strategy, the worst payoff for each decision would be the

*smallest*

value among all outcomes, and we would choose the decision corre-

sponding to the largest of these, called a

**maximin strategy**

.

■

■

For the opportunity-loss strategy, we need to be careful in calculating the oppor-  
tunity losses. With a maximize objective, the decision with the largest value for a   
particular event has an opportunity loss of zero. The opportunity losses associated   
with other decisions is the absolute difference between their payoff and the larg-  
est value. The actual decision is the same as when payoffs are costs: Choose the   
decision that minimizes the maximum opportunity loss.

[Decisions with Conflicting Objectives](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#15)

Many decisions require some type of trade-off among conflicting objectives, such as risk   
versus reward. For example, the Innis Investment e[xample in Figure 15.2 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#597)wed the results   
of solving a series of linear optimization models to find the minimum risk that would occur   
for achieving increasing levels of investment returns. We saw that as the return goes up,   
the risk begins to increase slowly, and then increases at a faster rate once a 6% investment   
target is achieved. What decision would be best? Another example we saw was the hotel   
overbooking model in[Chapter 12 (](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#452)[Example 12.15)](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#473). In this case, we can achieve lower   
costs but incur a loss in customer satisfaction and goodwill because of higher numbers of   
overbooked customers.

A simple decision rule can be used whenever one wishes to make an optimal trade-off

between any two conflicting objectives, one of which is good, and one of which is bad, that   
maximizes the ratio of the good objective to the bad (think of this as the "biggest bang for   
the buck").

1

First, display the trade-offs on a chart with the "good" objective on the

*x*

-axis

and the "bad" objective on the

*y*

-axis, making sure to scale the axes properly to display the

origin (0, 0). Then graph the tangent line to the trade-off curve that goes through the origin.   
The point at which the tangent line touches the curve (which represents the smallest slope)   
represents the best return to risk trade-off.

1

This rule was explained by Dr. Leonard Kleinrock at a lecture at the University of Cincinnati in 2011.

EXAMPLE 16.5

Risk-Reward Trade-off Decision for Innis Investments Example

[In Figure 15.2, if we take the ratios of the weighted returns](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#597)to the minimum risk values in the table, we will find that   
the largest ratio occurs for the target return of 6%. We can   
visualize this using the risk-reward trade-off curve and a   
[tangent line through the origin, as shown in Figure 16.1.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#638)

Note that the tangent line touches the curve at the 6%   
weighted return value. We can explain this easily from the   
chart by noting that for any other return, the risk is relatively   
larger (if all points fell on the tangent line, the risk would   
increase proportionately with the return).

Many other analytic techniques are available to deal with more complex multiple objec-

tive decisions. These include simple scoring models in which each decision is rated for each   
criterion (which may also be weighted to reflect the relative importance in comparison with   
other criteria). The ratings are summed over all criteria to rank the decision alternatives.   
Other techniques include variations of linear optimization known as

*goal programming*

,

and a pairwise comparison approach known as the

*analytic hierarchy process (AHP)*

.

The aggressive, conservative, and opportunity-loss strategies assume no knowledge of the   
probabilities associated with future outcomes. In many situations, we might have some   
assessment of these probabilities, through either some method of forecasting or reliance   
on expert opinions.

[Average Payoff Strategy](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#15)

If we can assess a probability for each outcome, we can choose the best decision based on   
the expected value [using concepts that we introduced in Chapter 5. F](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)or any decision, the   
expected value is the summation of the payoffs multiplied by their probability, summed   
over all outcomes. The simplest case is to assume that each outcome is equally likely to   
occur; that is, the probability of each outcome is simply 1/

*N*

, where

*N*

is the number of pos-

sible outcomes. This is called the

**average payoff strategy**

. This approach was proposed

by the French mathematician Laplace, who stated the

*principle of insufficient reason*

: If

there is no reason for one outcome to be more likely than another, treat them as equally   
likely. Under this assumption, we evaluate each decision by simply averaging the payoffs.   
We then select the decision with the best average payoff.

EXAMPLE 16.6

Mortgage Decision with the Average Payoff Strategy

For the mortgage selection problem, computing the average payoffs results in the following:

EXAMPLE 16.7

Mortgage Decision with the Expected Value Strategy

Suppose that we can estimate the probabilities of rates   
rising as 0.6, rates stable as 0.3, and rates falling as   
0.1. The following table shows the expected payoffs

associated with each decision. The smallest expected   
payoff, $54,135.20, occurs for the three-year ARM, which   
represents the best expected value decision.

A more general case of the average payoff strategy is when the probabilities of the out-  
comes are not all the same. This is called the

**expected value strategy**

. We may use the

expected value calculation [that we introduced in formul](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#217)[a (5.12) in Chapter 5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)  
![background image](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive640.png)

An implicit assumption in using the average payoff or expected value strategy is that the   
decision is repeated a large number of times. However, for any

*one-time*

decision (with the

trivial exception of equal payoffs), the expected value outcome will

*never occur*

. In the pre-

vious example, for instance, even though the expected value of the three-year ARM (the   
best decision) is $54,135.20, the actual result would be only one of three possible payoffs,   
depending on the outcome of the mortgage rate event: $56,901 if rates rise, $51,075 if rates   
remain stable, or $46,721 if rates fall. Thus, for a one-time decision, we must carefully weigh   
the risk associated with the decision in lieu of blindly choosing the expected value decision.

EXAMPLE 16.8

Evaluating Risk in the Mortgage Decision

In the mortgage selection example, although the average   
payoffs are fairly similar, note that the one-year ARM has a   
larger variation in the possible outcomes. We may compute   
the standard deviation of the outcomes associated with   
each decision:

Decision

Standard Deviation

1-year ARM

$10,763.80

3-year ARM

$5,107.71

30-year fixed

---

Based solely on the standard deviation, the 30-year   
fixed mortgage has no risk at all, whereas the one-year   
ARM appears to be the riskiest. Although based only on

three data points, the three-year ARM is fairly symmetric   
about the mean, whereas the one-year ARM is positively   
skewed---most of the variation around the average is   
driven by the upside potential (that is, lower costs), not the   
downside risk of higher costs. Although none of the formal   
decision strategies chose the three-year ARM, viewing   
risk from this perspective might lead to this decision. For   
instance, a conservative decision maker who is willing to   
tolerate a moderate amount of risk might choose the three-  
year ARM over the 30-year fixed because the downside risk   
is relatively small (and is smaller than the one-year ARM)   
and the upside potential is much larger. The larger upside   
potential associated with the one-year ARM might even   
make this decision attractive.

Thus, it is important to understand that making decisions under uncertainty cannot be

done using only simple rules, but by careful evaluation of risk versus rewards. This is why   
top executives make the big bucks. Evaluating risk in making a decision should also take   
into account the magnitude of potential gains and losses as well as their probabilities of   
occurrence, if this can be assessed. For example, a 70% chance of losing $10,000 against   
a 30% chance of gaining $500,000 might be viewed as an acceptable risk for a company,   
but a 10% chance of losing $250,000 against a 90% chance of gaining $500,000 might not.

Decision Analysis

A useful approach to structuring a decision problem involving uncertainty is to use a graphical   
model called a

**decision tree**

. Decision trees consist of a set of

**nodes**

and

**branches**

. Nodes are

points in time at which events take place. The event can be a selection of a decision from among   
several alternatives, represented by a

**decision node**

, or an outcome over which the decision

maker has no control, an

**event node**

. Event nodes are conventionally depicted by circles, and

decision nodes are expressed by squares. Branches are associated with decisions and events. We   
use a triangle to represent the terminal point of a decision path. Many decision makers find deci-  
sion trees useful because

*sequences*

of decisions and outcomes over time can be modeled easily.

EXAMPLE 16.9

Creating a Decision Tree

For the mortgage selection problem, we will first create a   
decision node for the selection of one of the three mortgage   
[instruments. This is shown in Figure 16.2. Although](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#641)somewhat tedious, you can create this on an Excel   
worksheet using the

Shapes

button from the

Insert

menu.

Next, add an event node at the end of the 1-Year ARM   
branch, with branches "Rates Rise," "Rates Stable," and   
"Rates Fall." We assign the probabilities to these outcomes   
[from Example 16.7 above the event branches. This creates](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#639)[the tree shown in Figure 16.3. Repeat this process for the](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#642)other two mortgage instrument branches.

Finally, enter the payoffs of the outcomes associated

with each event in the cells immediately below the   
branches. Because the payoffs are costs, we enter them   
as negative values, shown in parentheses using accounting   
formatting. Sum all payoffs along the paths and place these   
values next to the terminal nodes. (In this example, there   
are none associated with the decision branches, but we will   
see this in another example shortly.) The final decision tree   
[is shown in Figure 16.4.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#642)

Next, we need to analyze the decision tree to determine the best strategy that maxi-

mizes the expected value of the payoff. W[e illustrate this in Example 16.10.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#641)

EXAMPLE 16.10

Analyzing a Decision Tree

To find the best decision strategy in a decision tree, we   
"roll back" the tree by computing expected values at   
event nodes and selecting the optimal value of alternative   
decisions at decision nodes. For example, if the one-year   
ARM is chosen, the expected value of the chance events is   
0.6

accounting format), and repeat this process for each of

the other event nodes. At the decision node, the maximum   
expected value is chosen from among all decisions; this   
is

-

$54,135.20. Write this next to the decision node, as

shown in [Figure 16.5](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#644). Because this corresponds to the   
three-year ARM, which is branch 2, we can enter a 2 in   
the decision node, square to indicate the best decision.   
Therefore, the best strategy is to choose the three-year   
ARM, having an expected cost of $54,135.20 (the same   
decision we found in [Example 16.7](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#639)).

EXAMPLE 16.11

A Pharmaceutical R\&D Model

We will consider the R\&D process for a new drug (you   
might recall the basic financial model we developed for the   
[Moore Pharmaceuticals example in Chapter 11). Suppose](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#406)that the company has spent $300 million to date in research   
expenses. The first decision is whether or not to proceed   
with clinical trials. We can decide either to conduct them   
or to stop development at this point, incurring the $300   
million cost already spent on research. The cost of clinical   
trials is estimated to be $250 million, and the probability   
of a successful outcome is 0.3. Therefore, if we decide to   
conduct the trials, we face the chance events that the trials   
will be either successful or not successful. If they are not   
successful, then clearly the process stops at this point.   
If they are successful, the company may seek approval   
from the Food and Drug Administration or decide to stop   
the development process. The cost of seeking approval is   
$25 million, and there is a 60% chance of approval. If the   
company seeks approval, it faces the chance events that   
the FDA will approve the drug or not approve it. Finally,

if the drug is approved and is released to the market, the   
market potential has been identified as large, medium, or   
small, with the following characteristics:

[16.6. When we have sequences of decisions and events,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#645)a

decision strategy

is a specification of an initial decision

and subsequent decisions to make after knowing what   
events occur. We can identify the best strategy from the   
branch number in the decision nodes. For example, the   
best strategy is to conduct clinical trials and, if successful,   
seek FDA approval and, if approved, market the drug. The   
expected net revenue is calculated as $74.3 million.

[Decision Trees and Risk](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#16)

The decision tree approach is an example of expected value decision making. Thus, in the   
drug development example, if the company's portfolio of drug development projects has   
similar characteristics, then pursuing further development is justified on an expected value   
basis. However, this approach does not explicitly consider risk.

From a classical decision analysis perspective, we may summarize the Moore

Pharmaceutical's decision as the following payoff table:

Unsuccessful   
Clinical Trials

Successful

Clinical Trials; No

FDA Approval

Successful Trials

and Approval;

Large Market

Successful Trials

and Approval;

Medium Market

Many decision problems have multiple sequences of decisions and events, as illus-

trated in the next example. Decision trees are invaluable in helping managers understand   
the implications of uncertainty and decisions that have to be made over time.

If we apply the aggressive, conservative, and opportunity-loss decision strategies to

these data (note that the payoffs are profits as opposed to costs, so it is important to use the   
correct rule, as discussed earlier in the chapter), we obtain the following.

***Aggressive strategy (maximax)***

:

Chapter 16

Decision Analysis

617

The decision that minimizes the maximum opportunity loss is to develop the drug. How-  
ever, as we noted, we must evaluate risk by considering both the magnitude of the payoffs   
and their chances of occurrence. The aggressive, conservative, and opportunity-loss rules   
do not consider the probabilities of the outcomes.

Each decision strategy has an associated payoff distribution, called a

**risk profile**

.

Risk profiles show the possible payoff values that can occur and their probabilities.

EXAMPLE 16.12

Constructing a Risk Profile

In the drug development example, consider the strategy   
of pursuing development. The possible outcomes that can   
occur and their probabilities are the following:

Terminal Outcome

Net Revenue

Probability

Market large

$3,925

0.108

Market medium

$1,625

0.054

Market small

$925

0.018

FDA not approved

($575)

0.120

Clinical trials not   
successful

($550)

0.700

The probabilities are computed by multiplying the

probabilities on the event branches along the path to   
the terminal outcome. For example, the probability of   
getting to "Market large" is 0.3

\*

0.6

\*

0.6

=

0.108. Thus,

we see that the probability that the drug will not reach   
the market is 1

-

1

0.108

+

0.054

+

0.018

2

=

0.82, and

the company will incur a loss of more than $500 million.   
On the other hand, if they decide not to pursue clinical   
trials, the loss would be only $300 million, the cost of   
research to date. If this were a one-time decision, what   
decision would you make if you were a top executive of   
this company?

or not to discount the fare along with a what-if analysis of   
the impact of changing the probability that a full-fare ticket

sells before the flight. From the data table results, we see   
that if the probability of selling the full-fare ticket is 0.7 or   
less, then the best decision is to discount the price.

We may use Excel data tables to investigate the sensitivity of the optimal decision to   
changes in probabilities or payoff values. We illustrate this using the airline revenue   
management scenario [we discussed in Example 5.26 in Chapter 5.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#202)

When we deal with uncertain outcomes, it is logical to try to obtain better information   
about their likelihood of occurrence before making a decision. The

**value of information**

represents the improvement in the expected return that can be achieved if the decision   
maker is able to acquire---before making a decision---additional information about the   
future event that will take place. In the ideal case, we would like to have

**perfect informa-**

**tion**

, which tells us with certainty what outcome will occur. Although this will never occur,

it is useful to know the value of perfect information because it provides an upper bound on   
the value of any information that we may acquire. The

**expected value of perfect infor-**

**mation (EVPI)**

is the expected value with perfect information (assumed at no cost) minus

the expected value without any information; again, it represents the most you should be   
willing to pay for perfect information.

The

**expected opportunity loss**

represents the average additional amount the decision

maker would have achieved by making the right decision instead of a wrong one. To find   
the expected opportunity loss, we create an opportunity-loss table, as discussed earlier in   
this chapter, and then find the expected value for each decision.

*It will always be true that*

*the decision having the best expected value will also have the minimum expected opportu-
nity loss*

. The minimum expected opportunity loss is the EVPI.

CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

EXAMPLE 16.14

Finding EVPI for the Mortgage Selection Decision

The table below shows the calculations of the expected   
[opportunity losses for each decision (see Example 16.4 for](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#636)calculation of the opportunity-loss matrix). The minimum   
expected opportunity loss occurs for the three-year ARM   
(which was the best expected value decision) and is   
$3,391.40. This is the value of the EVPI.

Another way to understand this is to use the following

logic. Suppose we know that rates will rise. Then we   
should choose the 30-year fixed mortgage and incur   
a cost of $54,658. If we know that rates will be stable,   
then our best decision would be to choose the one-  
year ARM, with a cost of $46,443. Finally, if we know   
that rates will fall, we should choose the one-year ARM

with a cost of $40,161. By weighting these values by   
the probabilities that their associated events will occur,   
under

perfect information

, our expected cost would

the future, then we would choose the three-year ARM   
no matter what happens and incur an expected cost of   
$54,135.20. By having perfect information, we would save   
$54,135.20

-

$50,743.80

=

$3,391.40. This is the expected

value of perfect information. We would never want to pay

event, no matter how good.

**Sample information**

is the result of conducting some type of experiment, such as a market

research study or interviewing an expert. Sample information is always imperfect. Often,   
sample information comes at a cost. Thus, it is useful to know how much we should be   
willing to pay for it. The

**expected value of sample information (EVSI)**

is the expected

value with sample information (assumed at no cost) minus the expected value without   
sample information; it represents the most you should be willing to pay for the sample   
information.

EXAMPLE 16.15

Decisions with Sample Information

Suppose that a company is developing a new touch-screen   
cell phone. Historically, 70% of their new phones have   
resulted in high consumer demand, whereas 30% have   
resulted in low consumer demand. The company has the   
decision of choosing between two models with different   
features that require different amounts of investment and   
[also have different sales potential. Figure 16.8 shows a](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#648)completed decision tree in which all cash flows are in   
thousands of dollars. For example, model 1 requires an   
initial investment for development of $200,000, and model   
2 requires an investment of $175,000. If demand is high   
for model 1, the company will gain $500,000 in revenue,   
with a net profit of $300,000; it will receive only $160,000   
if demand is low, resulting in a net profit of

-

$40,000.

Based on the probabilities of demand, the expected profit   
is $198,000. For model 2, we see that the expected profit   
is only $188,000. Therefore, the best decision is to select   
model 1. Clearly, there is risk in either decision, but on an   
expected value basis, model 1 is the best decision.

Now suppose that the firm conducts a market research

study to obtain sample information and better understand

the nature of consumer demand. Analysis of past market   
research studies, conducted prior to introducing similar   
products, has found that 90% of all products that resulted   
in high consumer demand had previously received a high   
survey response, whereas only 20% of all products with   
ultimately low consumer demand had previously received   
a high survey response. These probabilities show that the   
market research is not always accurate and can lead to a   
false indication of the true market potential. However, we   
should expect that a high survey response would increase   
the historical probability of high demand, whereas a low   
survey response would increase the historical probability of   
a low demand. Thus, we need to compute the conditional   
probabilities:

P

low survey response

P

This can be accomplished using a formula called Bayes's

. As stated,

among all products that resulted in high

given

around. Because the probabilities

Although 70% of all previous new models historically

had high demand, knowing that the marketing report is   
favorable increases the likelihood to 91.3%, and if the   
marketing report is unfavorable, then the probability of low   
demand increases to 77%.

Finally, we need to compute the nonconditional

(marginal) probabilities that the survey response will be   
either high or low---that is,

The marginal probabilities state that there is a 69% chance   
that the survey will return a high-demand response, and   
there is a 31% chance that the survey will result in a low-  
demand response.

the probabilities we calculated in the previous example. The optimal decision strategy is to   
select model 1 if the survey response is high, and if the response is low, then select model   
2. Note that the expected value (which includes the probabilities of obtaining the survey   
[responses) is $202,257. Comparing this to Figure 16.8, we see that the sample information](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#648)increases the expected value by $ 202,257

An approach for assessing risk attitudes quantitatively is called

**utility theory**

. This

approach quantifies a decision maker's relative preferences for particular outcomes. We   
can determine an individual's utility function by posing a series of decision scenarios. This   
is best illustrated with an example; we use a personal investment problem to do this.

The first step in determining a utility function is to rank-order the payoffs from highest to   
lowest. We conveniently assign a utility of 1.0 to the highest payoff and a utility of 0 to the   
lowest. Next, for each payoff between the highest and lowest, consider the following situ-  
ation: Suppose you have the opportunity of achieving a

*guaranteed return of x*

or taking a

chance of receiving the highest payoff with probability

*p*

or the lowest payoff with prob-

ability 1

-

*p*

. (We use the term

**certainty equivalent**

to represent the amount that a decision

maker feels is equivalent to an uncertain gamble.) What value of

*p*

would make you indif-

ferent to these two choices? Then repeat this process for each payoff.

EXAMPLE 16.17

A Personal Investment Decision

Suppose that you have $10,000 to invest and are   
expecting to buy a new car in a year, so you can tie the   
money up for only 12 months. You are considering three   
options: a bank CD paying 4%, a bond mutual fund, and   
a stock fund. Both the bond and stock funds are sensitive   
to changing interest rates. If rates remain the same over   
the coming year, the share price of the bond fund is   
expected to remain the same, and you expect to earn   
$840. The stock fund would return about $600 in dividends

and capital gains. However, if interest rates rise, you can   
anticipate losing about $500 from the bond fund after   
taking into account the drop in share price and, likewise,   
expect to lose $900 from the stock fund. If interest rates   
fall, however, the yield from the bond fund would be   
$1,000 and the stock fund would net $1,700.[Table 16.2](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#651)summarizes the payoff table for this decision problem. The   
decision could result in a variety of payoffs, ranging from a   
profit of $1,700 to a loss of $900.

$1,000. The decision is illustrated

[in the simple decision tree in Figure 16.10. Because this](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#652)is a relatively high value, you decide that

p

would have to

be at least 0.9 to take this risk. This represents the utility

of a payoff of $1,000, denoted as

U

($1,000). For example,

$1,000 is this decision maker's certainty equivalent for the   
uncertain situation of receiving $1,700 with probability 0.9   
or

-

$900

with probability 0.1.

Chapter 16

Decision Analysis

623

If we compute the expected value of each of the gambles for the chosen values of

*p*

,

we see that they are higher than the corresponding payoffs. For example, for the payoff of   
$1,000 and the corresponding

*p*

=

0.9, the expected value of taking the gamble is

0.9

1

$1,700

2

+

0.1

1

-

$900

2

=

$1,440

This is greater than accepting $1,000 outright. We can interpret this to mean that you

require a risk premium of $1,440

-

$1,000

=

$440 to feel comfortable enough to risk

losing $900 if you take the gamble. In general, the

**risk premium**

is the amount an indi-

vidual is willing to forgo to avoid risk. This indicates that you are a

*risk-averse individual*

,

that is, relatively conservative.

Another way of viewing this is to find the

*break-even probability*

at which you would

be indifferent to receiving the guaranteed return and taking the gamble. This probability is   
found by solving the equation

1,700

*p*

1

-

*p*

2

=

1,000

resulting in

*p*

=

19

\>

26

=

0.73. Because you require a higher probability of winning the

gamble, it is clear that you are uncomfortable taking the risk.

If we graph the utility versus the payoffs, we can sketch a utility function, as shown

in [Figure 16.11.](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#653)This utility function is generally

*concave downward*

. This type of curve

is characteristic of risk-averse individuals. Such decision makers avoid risk, choosing con-  
servative strategies and those with high return-to-risk values. Thus, a gamble must have a   
higher expected value than a given payoff to be preferable or, equivalently, a higher prob-  
ability of winning than the break-even value.

Other individuals might be risk takers. What would their utility functions look like? As

you might suspect, they are

*concave upward*

. These individuals would take a gamble that

offers higher rewards even if the expected value is less than a certain payoff. An example   
of a utility function for a risk-taking individual in this situation is as follows:

Chapter 16

Decision Analysis

For the payoff of $1,000, this individual would be indifferent between receiving $1,000   
and taking a chance at $1,700 with probability 0.6 and losing $900 with probability 0.4.   
The expected value of this gamble is

0.6

1

$1,700

2

+

0.4

1

-

$900

2

=

$660

Because this is considerably less than $1,000, the individual is taking a larger risk to

try to receive $1,700. Note that the probability of winning is less than the break-even value.   
Risk takers generally prefer more aggressive strategies.

Finally, some individuals are risk neutral; they prefer neither taking risks nor avoiding

them. Their utility function is linear and corresponds to the break-even probabilities for   
each gamble. For example, a payoff of $600 would be equivalent to the gamble if

$600

=

*p*

$1,700

2

Solving for

*p*

\>

26, o r 0.58, which represents the utility of this payoff.

The decision of accepting $600 outright or taking the gamble could be made by flipping a   
coin. These individuals tend to ignore risk measures and base their decisions on the aver-  
age payoffs.

A utility function may be used instead of the actual monetary payoffs in a decision

analysis by simply replacing the payoffs with their equivalent utilities and then computing   
expected values. The expected utilities and the corresponding optimal decision strategy   
then reflect the decision maker's preferences toward risk. For example, if we use the aver-  
age payoff strategy (because no probabilities of events are given) for the data [in Table 16.2,](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#651)the best decision would be to choose the stock fund. However, if we replace the payoffs in   
[Table 16.2 with the (risk-a](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#651)verse) utilities that we defined and again use the average payoff   
strategy, the best decision would be to choose the bank CD as opposed to the stock fund,   
as shown in the following table.

If assessments of event probabilities are available, these can be used to compute the   
expected utility and identify the best decision.

[Exponential Utility Functions](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#16)

It can be rather difficult to compute a utility function, especially for situations involving a   
large number of payoffs. Because most decision makers typically are risk averse, we may   
use an exponential utility function to approximate the true utility function. The exponential   
utility function is

*R*

**(16.2)**

where

*e*

is the base of the natural logarithm (2.71828 . . . ) and

*R*

is a shape parameter that

[is a measure of risk tolerance. Figure 16.12 sho](Business Analytics – Methods, Models, and Decisions – 3rd -- James R_ Evans -- 2018 -- be1ced72b4a247c2647ce32961594b65 -- Anna’s Archive.html#654)ws several examples of

*U*

(

*x*

) for different

values of

*R*

. Notice that all these functions are concave and that as

*R*

increases, the func-

tions become flatter, indicating more tendency toward risk neutrality.

One approach to estimating a reasonable value of

*R*

is to find the maximum payoff

*R*

for

which the decision maker is willing to take an equal chance on winning

*R*

or losing

*R*

\>

2. The

smaller the value of

*R*

, the more risk averse is the individual. For instance, would you take

a bet on winning $10 versus losing $5? How about winning $10,000 versus losing $5,000?   
Most people probably would not worry about taking the first gamble but would think twice   
about the second. Finding one's maximum comfort level establishes the utility function.

Drug development in the United States is time consum-  
ing, resource intensive, risky, and heavily regulated. On   
average, it takes nearly 15 years to research and develop   
a drug in the United States, with an after-tax cost in 1990   
dollars of approximately $200 million.

In July 1999, the biological products leadership com-

mittee, composed of the senior managers within Bayer   
Biological Products (BP), a business unit of Bayer Phar-  
maceuticals (Pharma), made its newly formed strategic-

made the best drug development decisions, Pharma used a   
structured process based on the principles of decision analy-  
sis to evaluate the technical feasibility and market potential   
of its new drug. Previously, BP had analyzed a few business   
cases for review by Pharma. This commercial evaluation was   
BP's first decision analysis project.

Probability distributions of uncertain variables were

assessed by estimating the 10th percentile and 90th per-

results to make sure they accurately reflected his or   
her judgment. Pharma used net present value (NPV) as   
its decision-making criterion. Given the complexity and   
inherent structure of decisions concerning new drugs, the   
new-drug-development decision making was defined as a   
sequence of six decision points, with identified key mar-  
ket-related and scientific deliverables so senior managers

could assess the likelihood of success versus the company's   
exposure to risk, costs, and strategic fit. Decision point 1 was   
whether to begin preclinical development. After successful   
preclinical animal testing, Bayer can decide (decision point   
2) to begin testing the drug in humans. Decision point 3 and   
decision point 4 are both decisions to invest or not in con-  
tinuing clinical development. Following successful comple-  
tion of development, Bayer can choose to file a biological   
license application with the FDA (decision point 5). If the FDA   
approves it, Bayer can decide (decision point 6) to launch the   
new drug in the marketplace.

The project team presented their input assumptions and

recommendations for the commercial evaluation of the drug   
to the three levels of Pharma decision makers, who eventu-  
ally approved preclinical development. External validation of   
the data inputs and assumptions demonstrated their rigor   
and defensibility. Senior managers could compare the evalu-  
ation results for the proposed drug with those for other devel-  
opment drugs with confidence. The international committees   
lauded the project team's effort as top-notch, and the deci-  
sion-analysis approach set new standards for subsequent BP   
analyses.

in Carmel, Indiana, and shipped to distribution centers   
or major customers. DoorCo recently acquired another   
manufacturer of garage doors, Wisconsin Door, and is   
considering moving its wood door operations to the   
Wisconsin plant. Key considerations in this decision   
are the transportation, labor, and production costs at   
the two plants. Complicating matters is the fact that   
marketing is predicting a decline in the demand for   
wood doors. The company developed three scenarios:

Demand falls slightly, with no noticeable effect   
on production.

Demand and production decline 20%.

Suppose that a car-rental agency offers insurance   
for a week that costs $100. A minor fender bender   
will cost $3,500, whereas a major accident might   
cost $16,000 in repairs. Without the insurance, you   
would be personally liable for any damages. What   
should you do? Clearly, there are two decision alter-  
natives: take the insurance, or do not take the insur-  
ance. The uncertain consequences, or events that   
might occur, are that you would not be involved in   
an accident, that you would be involved in a fender   
bender, or that you would be involved in a major   
accident. Develop a payoff table for this situation.   
What decision should you make using each of the   
following strategies?

a.

aggressive strategy

conservative strategy

Slaggert Systems is considering becoming certified   
to the ISO 9000 series of quality standards. Becom-  
ing certified is expensive, but the company could lose   
a substantial amount of business if its major custom-  
ers suddenly demand ISO certification and the com-  
pany does not have it. At a management retreat, the   
senior executives of the firm developed the following   
payoff table, indicating the net present value of prof-  
its over the next five years.

What decisions should be made using the average   
payoff strategy in Problems 3, 4, and 5?

10.

For the DoorCo Corporation decision in Problem 2,   
suppose that the probabilities of the three scenarios   
are estimated to be 0.15, 0.40, and 0.45, respectively.   
Find the best expected value decision.

11.

For the car-rental situation described in Problem 3,   
assume that you researched insurance industry sta-  
tistics and found out that the probability of a major   
accident is 0.05% and that the probability of a fender   
bender is 0.16%. What is the expected value deci-  
sion? Would you choose this? Why or why not?

An information systems consultant is bidding on   
a project that involves some uncertainty. Based on   
past experience, if all went well (probability 0.1),   
the project would cost $1.2 million to complete.   
If moderate debugging were required (probability   
0.7), the project would probably cost $1.4 million. If   
major problems were encountered (probability 0.2),   
the project could cost $1.8 million. Assume that the   
consultant is bidding competitively and the expec-  
tation of successfully gaining the job at a bid of   
$2.2 million is 0, at $2.1 million is 0.1, at $2.0 mil-  
lion is 0.2, at $1.9 million is 0.3, at $1.8 million   
is 0.5, at $1.7 million is 0.8, and at $1.6 million is   
practically certain.

Midwestern Hardware must decide how many snow   
shovels to order for the coming snow season. Each   
shovel costs $15.00 and is sold for $29.95. No inven-  
tory is carried from one snow season to the next. Shov-  
els unsold after February are sold at a discount price of   
$10.00. Past data indicate that sales are highly dependent

on the severity of the winter season. Past seasons have   
been classified as mild or harsh, and the following dis-  
tribution of regular price demand has been tabulated:

Mild Winter

Shovels must be ordered from the manufacturer in

1,400, 1,600, 2,400, 2,600, and 3,000 units. Con-  
struct a decision tree to illustrate the components of   
the decision model, and find the optimal quantity for   
Midwestern to order if the forecast calls for a 40%   
chance of a harsh winter.

Dean Kuroff started a business of rehabbing old   
homes. He recently purchased a circa-1800 Vic-  
torian mansion and converted it into a three-family   
residence. Yesterday, one of his tenants complained   
that the refrigerator was not working properly. Dean's   
cash flow is not extensive, so he was not excited   
about purchasing a new refrigerator. He is consider-  
ing two other options: purchase a used refrigerator or   
repair the current unit. He can purchase a new one for   
$600, and it will easily last three years. If he repairs   
the current one, he estimates a repair cost of $150, but   
he also believes that there is only a 25% chance that it   
will last a full three years and he will end up purchas-  
ing a new one anyway. If he buys a used refrigerator   
for $200, he estimates that there is a 0.4 probability   
that it will last at least three years. If it breaks down,   
he will still have the option of repairing it for $150   
or buying a new one. Develop a decision tree for this   
situation and determine Dean's optimal strategy.

Many automobile dealers advertise lease options for   
new cars. Suppose that you are considering three   
alternatives:

1.

Purchase a car outright with cash.

2.

Purchase a car with 20% down and a 48-month

loan.

3.

Lease a car.

Select an automobile whose leasing contract is adver-  
tised in a local paper. Using current interest rates and   
advertised leasing arrangements, perform a decision   
analysis of these options. Make, but clearly define,   
any assumptions that may be required.

Perform a sensitivity analysis of the Midwestern   
Hardware scenario (Problem 15). Find the optimal   
order quantity and optimal expected profit for prob-  
abilities of a harsh winter ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 in   
increments of 0.2. Plot optimal expected profit as a   
function of the probability of a harsh winter.

The Value of Information

Mountain Ski Sports, a chain of ski equipment shops   
in Colorado, purchases skis from a manufacturer   
each summer for the coming winter season. The most   
popular intermediate model costs $150 and sells for   
$275. Any skis left over at the end of the winter are   
sold at the store's spring sale (for $100). Sales over   
the years have been quite stable. Gathering data from   
all its stores, Mountain Ski Sports developed the fol-  
lowing probability distribution for demand:

The manufacturer will take orders only for multiples   
of 20, so Mountain Ski is considering the following   
order sizes: 160, 180, 200, 220, and 240.

a.

Construct a payoff table for Mountain Ski's deci-  
sion problem of how many pairs of skis to order.   
What is the best decision from an expected value   
basis?

b.

Find the expected value of perfect information.

c.

What is the expected demand? What is the   
expected profit if the shop orders the expected   
demand? How does this compare with the   
expected value decision?

Bev's Bakery specializes in sourdough bread. Early   
each morning, Bev must decide how many loaves to   
bake for the day. Each loaf costs $1.25 to make and   
sells for $3.50. Bread left over at the end of the day   
can be sold the next day for $1.00. Past data indicate

A patient arrives at an emergency room complaining   
of abdominal pain. The ER physician must decide on   
whether to operate or to place the patient under obser-  
vation for a non-appendix-related condition. If an   
appendectomy is performed immediately, the doctor   
runs the risk that the patient does not have appendi-  
citis. If it is delayed and the patient does indeed have   
appendicitis, the appendix might perforate, leading to   
a more severe case and possible complications. How-  
ever, the patient might recover without the operation.

a.

Construct a decision tree for the doctor's dilemma.

b.

How might payoffs and probabilities be   
determined?

c.

Would utility be a better measure of payoff than   
actual costs? If so, how might utilities be derived   
for each path in the tree?

Decisions with Sample Information

22.

Drilling decisions by oil and gas operators involve   
intensive capital expenditures made in an environ-  
ment characterized by limited information and high   
risk. A well site is dry, wet, or gushing. Historically,   
50% of all wells have been dry, 30% wet, and 20%   
gushing. The value (net of drilling costs) for each   
type of well is as follows:

Dry

-

$80.000

Wet

$120,000

Gushing

$200,000

Wildcat operators often investigate oil prospects in

areas where deposits are thought to exist by making   
geological and geophysical examinations of the area   
before obtaining a lease and drilling permit. This often   
includes recording shock waves from detonations by

a seismograph and using a magnetometer to measure   
the intensity of Earth's magnetic effect to detect rock   
formations below the surface. The cost of doing such   
a study is approximately $15,000. Of course, one may   
choose to drill in a location based on "gut feel" and   
avoid the cost of the study. The geological and geo-  
physical examination classifies an area into one of   
three categories: no structure (NS), which is a bad sign;   
open structure (OS), which is an "OK" sign; and closed   
structure (CS), which is hopeful. Historically, 40% of   
the tests resulted in NS, 35% resulted in OS, and 25%   
resulted in CS readings. After the result of the test is   
known, the company may decide not to drill. The fol-  
lowing table shows probabilities that the well will actu-  
ally be dry, wet, or gushing based on the classification   
provided by the examination (in essence, the examina-  
tion cannot accurately predict the actual event):

Hahn Engineering is planning on bidding on a job   
and often competes against Sweigart and Associates   
(S\&A), as well as other firms. Historically, S\&A has   
bid for the same jobs 80% of the time; thus the prob-  
ability that S\&A will bid on this job is 0.80. If S\&A   
bids on a job, the probability that Hahn Engineering   
will win it is 0.30. If S\&A does not bid on a job, the   
probability that Hahn will win the bid is 0.60. Apply   
Bayes's rule to find the probability that Hahn Engi-  
neering will win the bid. If they do, what is the prob-  
ability that S\&A did bid on it?

MJ Logistics has decided to build a new warehouse   
to support its supply chain activities. They have the   
option of building either a large warehouse or a small   
one. Construction costs are $8 million for the large   
facility versus $3 million for the small facility. The   
profit (excluding construction cost) depends on the   
volume of work the company expects to contract for

in the future. This is summarized in the following   
table (in millions of dollars):

High Volume

Low Volume

Large warehouse

$35

$20

Small warehouse

$25

$15

The company believes that there is a 60% chance that

the volume of demand will be high.

a.

Construct a decision tree to identify the best choice.

b.

Suppose that the company engages an economic   
expert to provide an opinion about the volume   
of work based on a forecast of economic condi-  
tions. Historically, the expert's upside predictions   
have been 75% accurate, whereas the downside   
predictions have been 90% accurate. In contrast   
to the company's assessment, the expert believes   
that the chance for high demand is 70%. Deter-  
mine the best strategy if their predictions suggest   
that the economy will improve or will deteriorate.   
Given the information, what is the probability   
that the volume will be high?

Utility and Decision Making

25.

Consider the car-rental insurance scenario in Prob-  
lems 4 and 11. Use the approach described in this   
chapter to develop your personal utility function   
for the payoffs associated with this decision. Deter-  
mine the decision that would result using the utilities   
instead of the payoffs. Is the decision consistent with   
your choice?

A college football team is trailing 14--0 late in the   
game. The team just made a touchdown. If they can   
hold the opponent and score one more time, they can   
tie or win the game. The coach is wondering whether   
to go for an extra-point kick or a two-point conver-  
sion now, and what to do if they score again.

a.

Develop a decision tree for the coach's decision.

b.

Estimate probabilities for successful kicks or   
two-point conversions and a last-minute score.   
(You might want to do this by doing some group   
brainstorming or by calling on experts, such as   
your school's coach or a sports journalist.) Using   
the probabilities from part a, determine the opti-  
mal strategy.

c.

Why would utility theory be a better approach   
than using the points for making a decision? Pro-  
pose a utility function and compare your results.

PLE has developed a prototype for a new snow blower   
for the consumer market. This can exploit the company's   
expertise in small-gasoline-engine technology and also   
balance seasonal demand cycles in the North American   
and European markets to provide additional revenues   
during the winter months. Initially, PLE faces two possi-  
ble decisions: introduce the product globally at a cost of   
$850,000 or evaluate it in a North American test market   
at a cost of $200,000. If it introduces the product glob-  
ally, PLE might find either a high or low response to the   
product. The probabilities of these events are estimated   
to be 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. With a high response,   
gross revenues of $2,000,000 are expected; with a low   
response, the figure is $450,000. If PLE starts with a   
North American test market, it might find a low response   
or a high response, with probabilities of 0.3 and 0.7,   
respectively. This may or may not reflect the global mar-  
ket potential. In any case, after conducting the market-  
ing research, PLE next needs to decide whether to keep

sales only in North America, market globally, or drop   
the product. If the North American response is high and   
PLE stays only in North America, the expected revenue   
is $1,200,000. If it markets globally (at an additional cost   
of $200,000), the probability of a high global response is   
0.9 with revenues of $2,000,000 ($450,000 if the global   
response is low). If the North American response is low   
and it remains in North America, the expected revenue is   
$200,000. If it markets globally (at an additional cost of   
$600,000), the probability of a high global response is   
0.05, with revenues of $2,000,000 ($450,000 if the global   
response is low).

Construct a decision tree, determine the optimal

strategy, and develop a risk profile associated with the   
optimal strategy. Evaluate the sensitivity of the optimal   
strategy to changes in the probability estimates. Sum-  
marize all your results, including your recommendation   
and justification for it, in a formal report to the executive   
committee, who will ultimately make this decision.

which proceed by a series of fusions of the

*n*

objects into groups.

Glossary

Type II error.

The null hypothesis is actually false, but the hypothesis

test incorrectly fails to reject it.

Two-tailed test of hypothesis.

The rejection region occurs in both

the upper and lower tail of the distribution

Two-way data table.

A data table that evaluates an output variable

over a range of values for two different input variables.

Unbounded solution.

A solution that has the value of the objective

to be increased or decreased without bound (i.e., to infinity for   
a maximization problem or negative infinity for a minimization   
problem) without violating any of the constraints.

Uncertain function.

A cell referred, by

*Analytic Solver Platform*

, for

which prediction and creation of a distribution of output values   
from the model is carried out.

Uncertain events.

An event that occurs after a decision is made

along with its possible outcome.

Uncertainty.

Imperfect knowledge of what will happen.

Utility theory.

An approach for assessing risk attitudes quantitatively.

Uniform distribution.

A function that characterizes a continuous ran-

dom variable for which all outcomes between some minimum   
and maximum value are equal likely.

Unimodal.

Histograms with only one peak.

Union.

A composition of all outcomes that belongs to either of two

events.

Unique optimal solution.

The exact single solution that will result in

the maximum (or minimum) objective.

Value of information.

Represents the improvement in the expected

return that can be achieved if the decision maker is able to   
acquire---before making a decision---additional information   
about the future event that will take place.

Validity.

An estimate of whether the data correctly measure what they

are supposed to measure; a term that refers to how well a model   
represents reality.

Variance.

The average of the squared deviations of the observations

from the mean; a common measure of dispersion.

Verification.

The process of ensuring that a model is accurate and

free from logical errors.

Visualization.

The most useful component of business analytics that

is truly unique.

Ward's hierarchical clustering.

The clustering method uses a sum-

of-squares criterion.

What-if analysis.

The analysis shows how specific combinations of

inputs that reflect key assumptions will affect model outputs.
